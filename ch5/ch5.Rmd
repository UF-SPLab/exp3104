# Perceptual Organization

###	Discuss Gestalt psychology and the laws of perceptual organization.
###	Explain figure-ground segregation and identify the properties of figure-ground, gist of a scene.
### Describe the “oblique effect” and the “light-from-above” assumption, and discuss how these exemplifies the relationship between environmental regularities, physiology, and perception.

# Gestalt Principles 

- **Good continuation**: connected points resulting in *straight or smooth* curves belong together (Lines are seen as following the smoothest path)



- **Pragnanz**: (conciseness, simplicity, good form) every stimulus is seen as *simply* as possible



- **Similarity**: similar things are grouped together



- **Proximity**: things that are *near* to each other are grouped together



- **Common fate**: things *moving in same* direction are grouped together



- **Common region**: elements in the *same region* tend to be grouped together 



- **Uniform connectedness**: *connected* visual properties are perceived as single unit

# Perceptual Segregation

- Figure vs. (Back)Ground: determining what part of environment is the figure so that it "stands out" from the background
    - **figure** more “thinglike” & more memorable
    - **figure** *in front of* ground
    - **ground** more uniform & *extends behind* figure
    
- **Border Ownership**: Contour separating figure & ground *belongs* to figure

# Perceiving Scenes and Objects in Scenes

### Discuss research on semantic regularities in scenes.
### Discuss Helmholtz’s theory of unconscious inference, and Bayesian inference.

# Perceiving Scenes and Objects in Scenes
- Information within the image determines perception-grouping.
- Areas lower in the field of view are more likely to be perceived as a figure.

# Perceiving the Gist of a Scene
- A scene contains:
    - Background elements
    - Objects organized in meaningful ways with each other and the background
- Difference between objects and scenes
    - A scene is acted within.
    - An object is acted upon.

# Perceiving the Gist of a Scene

- Color
- Degree of:
   - naturalness
   - openness
   - roughness
   - expansion 
  
Scene features are </br> holistic and </br>perceived rapidly.

Figure 5.35 In these two scenes from nature, horizontal and vertical orientations are more common than oblique orientations. 
- These scenes are special examples, picked because the large proportion of verticals. 
- However, randomly selected photos of natural scenes also contain more horizontal and vertical orientations than oblique orientations. 
- This also occurs for human-made buildings and objects

# .font60[Regularities in the Environment: Information for Perceiving]
- **Physical regularities**: regularly occurring physical properties
    - Homogenous colors and nearby objects have different colors.
    - **Light-from-above** heuristic: light in natural environment comes from above us.

Figure 12.4 Effect of the light-from-above prior on perception using ambiguous images. The left and right images show footprints in the sand. In the left image the light illuminating the scene is actually coming from above, and the footprint is correctly seen as an indentation. In the right image, which is the left image presented upside down, the light is coming from below. Employing the light-from-above prior in this situation causes the footprint to be seen as embossed or raised from the surface.

# Role of Inference in Perception

    - Created by Helmholtz (1866/1911) to explain why stimuli can be interpreted in more than one way
    - Likelihood principle: objects are perceived based on what is most likely to have caused the pattern
- Modern researchers use Bayesian inference that take probabilities into account.

Figure 5.40 These graphs present hypothetical probabilities, to illustrate the principle behind Bayesian inference. (a) Maria’s beliefs about the relative frequency of having a cold, lung disease, and heartburn. These beliefs are her priors. (b) Further data indicate that colds and lung disease are associated with coughing, but heartburn is not. These data contribute to the likelihood. (c) Taking the priors and likelihood together results in the conclusion that Charles’s cough is probably due to a cold.

Figure 5.41 Observers in Tong et al.’s (1998) experiment viewed the overlapping red house and green face through red–green glasses
- so the house image was presented to the right eye and the face image to the left eye. 
- Because of binocular rivalry, the observers’ perception alternated back and forth between the face and the house. 
- When the observers perceived the house, activity occurred in the parahippocampal place area (PPA) in the left and right hemispheres (red ellipses). 
- When observers perceived the face, activity occurred in the fusiform face area (FFA) in the left hemisphere (green ellipse).
