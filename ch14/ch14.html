# Perception by the Skin and Hands
![:hline]()
### Name the three parts of the somatosensory system, and &lt;br/&gt; outline the functions of the skin.
### Describe the layers of the skin and the types of mechanoreceptors.

# The Somatosensory System
- Three parts
    - **Cutaneous senses**: perception of touch and pain from stimulation of the skin
    - **Proprioception**: ability to sense position of the body and limbs
    - **Kinesthesis**: ability to sense movement of body and limbs

# Overview of the Cutaneous System
- **Skin**: heaviest organ in the body
    - Protects the organism by keeping damaging agents from penetrating the body
    - Epidermis is the outer layer of the skin, which is made up of dead skin cells.
    - Dermis is below the epidermis and contains mechanoreceptors that respond to stimuli such as pressure, stretching, and vibration.

# Pathways from Skin to Cortex
.pull-left[
Nerve fibers travel in bundles (peripheral nerves) to the spinal cord.  
###Major spinal cord pathways:
- **Medial lemniscal pathway** consists of large fibers that carry proprioceptive and touch information.
- **Spinothalamic pathway** consists of smaller fibers that carry temperature and pain information.
    - These cross over to the opposite side of the body and synapse in the thalamus.

Figure 14.4 The pathway from receptors in the skin to the somatosensory receiving area of the cortex. The fiber carrying signals from a receptor in the finger enters the spinal cord through the dorsal root. The signals then travel up the spinal cord along two pathways: the medial lemniscus and the spinothalamic tract. These pathways synapse in the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus and then send signals to the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe.

    - Body map (homunculus) on the cortex in S1 and S2 shows more cortical space allocated to parts of the body that are responsible for detail.
- Plasticity in neural functioning leads to multiple homunculi and changes in how cortical cells are allocated to body parts.

    - **Two-point** threshold: minimum separation needed between two points to perceive them as two units

# Receptor Mechanisms for Tactile Acuity
- There is a high density of Merkel receptors in the fingertips.
- Merkel receptors are densely packed on the fingertips: similar to cones in the fovea.
- Both two-point thresholds and grating acuity studies show these results.

- Body areas with high acuity have larger areas of cortical tissue devoted to them.
    - This parallels the "magnification factor" seen in the visual cortex for the cones in the fovea.
    - Areas with higher acuity also have smaller receptive fields on the skin.

# Perceiving Vibration and Texture
![:hline]()
### Identify the receptor mechanisms and cortical mechanisms that are responsible for tactile acuity and feeling vibrations.
### Describe the duplex theory of texture perception &amp; support with research.

---

# Vibration of the Skin
.pull-left[
- Pacinian corpuscle (PC) is primarily responsible for sensing vibration.
    - Nerve fibers associated with PCs respond best to high rates of vibration.
    - The structure of the PC is responsible for the response to vibration: fibers without the PC only respond to continuous pressure.
]
.pull-right[
![](fig_14_11.png)
]

???

Figure 14.11 (a) When a vibrating pressure stimulus is applied to the Pacinian corpuscle, it transmits these pressure vibrations to the nerve fiber. (b) When a continuous pressure stimulus is applied to the Pacinian corpuscle, it does not transmit the continuous pressure to the fiber. (c) Lowenstein determined how the fiber fired to stimulation of the corpuscle (at A) and to direct stimulation of the fiber (at B).

---

# Surface Texture
.pull-left[
- Katz (1925) proposed that perception of texture depends on two cues.
    - Spatial cues are determined by the size, shape, and distribution of surface elements.
    - Temporal cues are determined by the rate of vibration as skin is moved across finely textured surfaces.
- Two receptors may be responsible for this process: the duplex theory of texture perception.
]
.pull-right[
![](fig_14_12.png)
]
???

Figure 14.12 The post in (a) is illuminated from the left. The close-up in (b) shows how the visual perception of texture is influenced by illumination. Although the surface on the right side of the pole appears rougher than on the left, the surface textures of the two sides are identical.

---

# Spatial and Temporal Cues
- Past research showed support for the role of spatial cues.
- Recent research by Hollins and Reisner shows support for the role of temporal cues.
    - In order to detect differences between fine textures, participants needed to move their fingers across the surface.

# Perceiving Objects
![:hline]()
### Summarize the exploratory procedures used in haptic exploration and the physiology of tactile object perception.

---

# Adaptation Experiment

.pull-left[
- Adaptation experiment: participants' skin was adapted with either
    - 10-Hz stimulus for six minutes to adapt the Meissner corpuscle
    - 250-Hz stimulus for six minutes to adapt the Pacinian corpuscle
- Results showed that only the adaptation to the 250-Hz stimulus affected the perception of fine textures.
]
.pull-right[

![](fig_14_13.png)
]

???

Figure 14.13 Eliminating the action of fibers associated with the Meissner corpuscle by adaptation to a 10-Hz vibration had no effect on perception of a fine texture, but eliminating the action of the Pacinian corpuscle by adapting to a 250-Hz vibration eliminated the ability to sense the fine textures.

# Perceiving Objects
- Humans use active rather than passive touch  to interact with the environment.
- Haptic perception is the active exploration of 3-D objects with the hand.
    - It uses three distinct systems
        - Sensory system
        - Motor system
        - Cognitive system

# Perceiving Objects

- Psychophysical research shows that people can identify objects haptically in one to two seconds.
- Klatzky et al. have shown that people use exploratory procedures (EPs).

Figure 14.14 Some of the exploratory procedures (EPs) observed by Lederman and Klatzky as participants identified objects. 

- Lateral motion: The skin is passed laterally across a surface, producing shear force.
- Contour following: Skin contact follows the gradient of the object's surface or is maintained along edges when they are present.
- Pressure: Force is exerted on the object against a resisting force; for example, by pressing into the surface, bending the object, or twisting.
- Enclosure: The fingers (or other exploring effector) are molded closely to the object surface.
- Static contact: The skin surface is held in contact with the object surface, without motion; typically a large surface (like the whole hand) is applied. This EP gives rise to heat flow between the skin and the object.
- Unsupported holding: The object is held while the hand is not externally supported; typically this EP involves lifting, hefting or wielding the object.

- Monkey's somatosensory cortex also shows neurons that respond best to:
    - Grasping specific objects 
    - Paying attention to the task

(b) The records on the right indicate nerve firing for movement of a stimulus across the fingertip from right to left (top) and from left to right (bottom). This neuron responds best when a stimulus moves across the fingertip from right to left.

# Pain Perception
![:hline]()
### Types of Pain
### Distinguish among the three different types of pain.

---

# Pain Perception
- Pain is a multimodal phenomenon containing a sensory component and an affective or emotional component.

![:positionImage 50%, 55%, 0deg, 400px](fig_14_24.png)
![:positionImage 25%, 2%, 0deg, 500px](WB_Faces_Pain_Scale.jpg)

# Pain Perception

- **Inflammatory pain**: caused by damage to tissues and joints or by tumor cells
- **Neuropathic pain**: caused by damage to the central nervous system 
    - Brain damage caused by stroke; repetitive movements
- **Nociceptive**: signals impending damage to the skin
    - Respond to heat, chemicals, severe pressure, and cold
    - Threshold of eliciting receptor response must be balanced to warn of damage, but not be affected by normal activity.


![:positionImage 45%, 25%, 0deg, 500px](fig_14_21.png)

???

Figure 14.21 Nociceptive pain is created by activation of nociceptors in the skin that respond to different types of stimulation. Signals from the nociceptors are transmitted to the spinal cord and then up the spinal cord in pathways that lead to the brain.

**Direct model**: stimulated nociceptors send signals directly to brain.  
  
Problems with **Direct** pathway model:
- Pain can be affected by a person's mental state.
- Pain can occur when there is no stimulation of the skin.
- Pain can be affected by attention.
- Phantom limbs
