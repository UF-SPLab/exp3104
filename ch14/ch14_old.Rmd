The Cutaneous Senses
The Somatosensory System
Three parts
Cutaneous senses: perception of touch and pain from stimulation of the skin
Proprioception: ability to sense position of the body and limbs
Kinesthesis: ability to sense movement of body and limbs
Overview of the Cutaneous System
Skin: heaviest organ in the body
Protects the organism by keeping damaging agents from penetrating the body
Epidermis is the outer layer of the skin, which is made up of dead skin cells.
Dermis is below the epidermis and contains mechanoreceptors that respond to stimuli such as pressure, stretching, and vibration.
Overview of the Cutaneous System (cont'd.)


Mechanoreceptors
Two types located close to surface of the skin
Merkel receptor fires continuously while stimulus is present.
Responsible for sensing fine details
Meissner corpuscle fires only when a stimulus is first applied and when it is removed.
Responsible for controlling hand-grip
Mechanoreceptors (cont'd.)


Mechanoreceptors (cont'd.)
Two types located deeper in the skin
Ruffini cylinder fires continuously to stimulation.
Associated with perceiving stretching of the skin
Pacinian corpuscle fires only when a stimulus is first applied and when it is removed.
Associated with sensing rapid vibrations and fine texture
Mechanoreceptors (cont'd.)


Pathways from Skin to Cortex
Nerve fibers travel in bundles (peripheral nerves) to the spinal cord.
Two major pathways in the spinal cord
Medial lemniscal pathway consists of large fibers that carry proprioceptive and touch information.
Spinothalamic pathway consists of smaller fibers that carry temperature and pain information.
These cross over to the opposite side of the body and synapse in the thalamus.
Pathways from Skin to Cortex (cont'd.)


The Somatosensory Cortex
Signals travel from the thalamus to the somatosensory receiving area (S1) and the secondary receiving area (S2) in the parietal lobe.
Body map (homunculus) on the cortex in S1 and S2 shows more cortical space allocated to parts of the body that are responsible for detail.
Plasticity in neural functioning leads to multiple homunculi and changes in how cortical cells are allocated to body parts.

The Somatosensory Cortex (cont'd.)



Perceiving Details
Measuring tactile acuity
Two-point threshold: minimum separation needed between two points to perceive them as two units
Grating acuity: placing a grooved stimulus on the skin and asking the participant to indicate the orientation of the grating
Raised pattern identification: using such patterns to determine the smallest size that can be identified
Perceiving Details (cont'd.)


Receptor Mechanisms for Tactile Acuity
There is a high density of Merkel receptors in the fingertips.
Merkel receptors are densely packed on the fingertips: similar to cones in the fovea.
Both two-point thresholds and grating acuity studies show these results.

Cortical Mechanisms for Tactile Acuity
Body areas with high acuity have larger areas of cortical tissue devoted to them.
This parallels the ‚Äúmagnification factor‚Äù seen in the visual cortex for the cones in the fovea.
Areas with higher acuity also have smaller receptive fields on the skin.

Vibration of the Skin
Pacinian corpuscle (PC) is primarily responsible for sensing vibration.
Nerve fibers associated with PCs respond best to high rates of vibration.
The structure of the PC is responsible for the response to vibration: fibers without the PC only respond to continuous pressure.
Vibration of the Skin (cont'd.)


Surface Texture
Katz (1925) proposed that perception of texture depends on two cues.
Spatial cues are determined by the size, shape, and distribution of surface elements.
Temporal cues are determined by the rate of vibration as skin is moved across finely textured surfaces.
Two receptors may be responsible for this process: the duplex theory of texture perception.
Surface Texture (cont'd.)


Spatial and Temporal Cues
Past research showed support for the role of spatial cues.
Recent research by Hollins and Reisner shows support for the role of temporal cues.
In order to detect differences between fine textures, participants needed to move their fingers across the surface.
Adaptation Experiment
Adaptation experiment: participants‚Äô skin was adapted with either
10-Hz stimulus for six minutes to adapt the Meissner corpuscle
250-Hz stimulus for six minutes to adapt the Pacinian corpuscle
Results showed that only the adaptation to the 250-Hz stimulus affected the perception of fine textures.

Perceiving Objects
Humans use active rather than passive touch  to interact with the environment.
Haptic perception is the active exploration of 3-D objects with the hand.
It uses three distinct systems
Sensory system
Motor system
Cognitive system
Perceiving Objects (cont'd.)
Psychophysical research shows that people can identify objects haptically in one to two seconds.
Klatzky et al. have shown that people use exploratory procedures (EPs).
Lateral motion
Contour following
Pressure
Enclosure

The Cortical Physiology of Tactile Object Perception
The firing pattern of groups of mechanoreceptors signals shape, such as the curvature of an object.
Neurons further upstream become more specialized.
Monkey‚Äôs thalamus shows cells that respond to center-surround receptive fields.
Somatosensory cortex shows cells that respond maximally to orientations and direction of movement.
The Cortical Physiology of Tactile Object Perception (cont'd.)


The Physiology of Tactile Object Perception
Monkey‚Äôs somatosensory cortex also shows neurons that respond best to:
Grasping specific objects
Paying attention to the task
Neurons may respond to stimulation of the receptors, but attending to the task increases the response.

Pain Perception
Pain is a multimodal phenomenon containing a sensory component and an affective or emotional component.
Pain Perception (cont'd.)
Three types of pain
Inflammatory pain: caused by damage to tissues and joints or by tumor cells
Neuropathic pain: caused by damage to the central nervous system
Brain damage caused by stroke; repetitive movements
Nociceptive: signals impending damage to the skin
Respond to heat, chemicals, severe pressure, and cold
Threshold of eliciting receptor response must be balanced to warn of damage, but not be affected by normal activity.
Pain Perception (cont'd.)



The Gate Control Model of Pain
Early model that stated nociceptors are stimulated and send signals to the brain.
Problems with the direct pathway model
Pain can be affected by a person‚Äôs mental state.
Pain can occur when there is no stimulation of the skin.
Pain can be affected by a person‚Äôs attention.
Phantom limbs
The Gate Control Model of Pain (cont'd.)


The Gate Control Model of Pain (cont'd.)
Gate control: pain signals enter spinal cord from the body and transmitted to the brain.
Additional pathways that influence the signals from spinal cord to the brain can open or close a gate in the spinal cord.
Cells in the dorsal horn of spinal cord
Nociceptors
Mechanoreceptors
Central control

Top-Down Processes
Expectation: when surgical patients are told what to expect, they request less pain medication and leave the hospital earlier.
Placebos can also be effective in reducing pain.
Shifting attention: virtual reality technology has been used to keep patients‚Äô attention on other stimuli than the pain-inducing stimulation.

Top-Down Processes (cont'd.)
Emotions: participants could keep their hands in cold water longer when pictures they were shown were positive.
Looking at pictures
Listening to music (Roy, 2008 experiment)
Top-Down Processes (cont'd.)



The Brain and Pain
Subcortical areas, including the hypothalamus, limbic system, and the thalamus
Cortical areas, including S1 in the somatosensory cortex, the insula, and the anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices
These cortical areas taken together are called the pain matrix.
The Brain and Pain (cont'd.)


The Brain and Pain (cont'd.)
Experiment by Hoffauer et al.
Participants were presented with potentially painful stimuli and asked
To rate subjective pain intensity
To rate the unpleasantness of the pain
Brain activity was measured while they placed their hands into hot water.
Hypnosis was used to increase or decrease the sensory and affective components.
The Brain and Pain (cont'd.)
Results:
Suggestions to change the subjective intensity led to changes in both ratings and in activity in S1.
Suggestions to change the unpleasantness of pain did not affect the subjective ratings, but did change ratings of unpleasantness.

The Brain and Pain (cont'd.)



The Brain and Pain (cont'd.)
Opioids and pain
Brain tissue releases neurotransmitters called endorphins.
Evidence shows that endorphins reduce pain.
Injecting naloxone blocks the receptor sites causing more pain.
Naloxone also decreases the effectiveness of placebos.
People whose brains release more endorphins can withstand higher pain levels.
