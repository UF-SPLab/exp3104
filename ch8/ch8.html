# Perceiving Motion

![](fig_8_1.png)

???
Figure 8.1 Motion perception occurs (a) when a stationary observer perceives moving stimuli, such as this couple crossing the street, and (b) when a moving observer, like this basketball player, perceives moving stimuli, such as the other players on the court.

---

# Functions of Movement Perception
- Survival in the environment
    - Predators use movement of prey as a primary means of location in hunting.
    - Attentional capture: motion attracts attention to the moving object.
    - Thus, if prey remains motionless, it is less likely to be noticed.
    - Akinetopsia: blindness to motion

Figure 8.4 Still images from a film like one used by Heider and Simmel (1944). The objects moved in various ways, going in and out of the “house” and sometimes interacting with each other. The nature of the movements led subjects to make up stories that often described the objects as having feelings, motivations, and personalities.

# Studying Motion Perception
- Real motion: an object is physically moving
- Illusory motion
    - Apparent movement: stationary stimuli are presented in slightly different locations
    - Basis of movement in movies and TV 
- Induced motion: movement of one object results in the perception of movement in another object.

# Studying Motion Perception
- Motion aftereffect  
    - Observer looks at movement of object for 30 to 60 seconds.
    - Then, observer looks at a stationary object.
    - Movement appears to occur in the opposite direction from the original movement.
    - The waterfall illusion is an example of this.

# .font70[Comparison of Real and Apparent Motion]
- Experiment by Larsen et al.
    - Participant is scanned by an fMRI while viewing three displays.
- Control condition: two dots in different positions are flashed simultaneously.
- Real motion: a small dot is moved back and forth.
- Apparent motion: dots are flashed so they appear to move.

---

# .font70[Comparison of Real and Apparent Motion]
- Results:
    - Control condition: each dot activated a separate area of visual cortex.
    - Apparent and real motion: activation of visual cortex from both sets of stimuli was similar. 
- Thus, the perception of motion in both cases is related to the same brain mechanism.

Stimuli are shown on top and the resulting brain activation is shown below. In (c), the brain is activated in the space that represents the area between the two dots, where movement was perceived but no stimulus was present.

Panels (a) and (b) show activity within the detector as an object moves from left to right at two different points in time. The signals from neurons A and B meet at the output unit, and motion is perceived. Panels (c), (d), and (e) show activity within the same detector when an object moves from right to left at two points in time. In this case, the signals from A and B do not meet at the output unit, so no motion is perceived.

# Motion Perception: Retina/Eye Information

### Corollary discharge theory

Movement perception depends on three signals:

- **Image displacement signal** (IDS): movement of image stimulating receptors across the retina
- **Motor signal** (MS): signal sent to eyes to move eye muscles
- **Corollary discharge signal** (CDS): split from the motor signal

According to the corollary discharge model: 
1. when the IDS reaches the comparator alone, a signal is sent to the brain and motion is perceived; 
2. when the CDS reaches the comparator alone, a signal is sent to the brain and motion is perceived; 
3. if both a CDS and an IDS reach the comparator simultaneously, they cancel each other, so no signals are sent to the brain and no motion is perceived.

In both cases, a bar (B) sweeps across the neuron’s receptive field (RF) as the monkey looks at a fixation point (FP). (a) The neuron fires when the bar moves to the left across the receptive field. (b) The neuron doesn’t fire when the eye moves to the right even though this causes the bar to move across the receptive field.

# Motion Perception in the Brain
- Perception of motion begins in the striate cortex, the region of the occipital lobe where information from the retinas first reaches the cortex. 
- Neurons on the striate cortex respond to movement of the ends of objects.
- Middle temporal (MT) area

# Motion Perception in the Brain

Firing and coherence experiment by Newsome et al.
- Coherence of movement of dot patterns was varied.
- Monkeys were taught to judge direction of dot movement and measurements were taken from MT neurons.
- *Results*: increased coherence of dot movement led to increased MT neuron firing &amp; movement accuracy judgment.

Each dot survives for a brief interval (20–30 microseconds), after which it disappears and is replaced by another randomly placed dot. Coherence is the percentage of dots moving in the same direction at any point in time. (a) Coherence 50 percent. (b) Coherence 550 percent. (c) Coherence 5100 percent.

The ellipse represents the area in an observer’s field of view that corresponds to the receptive field of a cortical neuron on the observer’s retina. The pole’s motion across the receptive field is also horizontal to the right (red arrows). (b) In this situation the pole’s overall motion is up and to the right (blue arrows). However, the pole’s motion across the receptive field is horizontal to the right (red arrows), as in (a). Thus, the receptive field “sees” the same motion for motion that is horizontal and motion that is up and to the right
