# Stressed out  

[21 Pilots](https://youtu.be/pXRviuL6vMY?t=90)

&gt;Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young  
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from  
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it  
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one

# Taste Quality
### Identify functions of taste, identify taste qualities, &amp; structures and functions of taste system.


---

# The Function of Chemical Senses
- "Gatekeepers" of the body: 
    - Identify things that should be consumed for survival
    - Detect things that would be harmful and should be rejected
    - Cause good and bad affective responses

# Basic Taste Qualities
.pull-left[
- Five basic taste qualities
    - **Salty**
    - **Sour**
    - **Sweet**
    - **Bitter**
    - **Umami**: described as meaty, brothy or savory, and associated with MSG

# .font60[Connections Between Taste Quality &amp; a Substance's Effect]
.pull-left[
### Sweetness
- is usually associated with substances that have *.bold.green[nutritive]* value.
  
### Bitter
- is usually associated with substances that are *potentially .bold.blue[harmful]*.
  
### Salty 
- taste indicates the presence of **sodium**.
  
However, there is not a perfect connection between tastes and function of substances.

# Structure of the Taste System

.pull-left[
Tongue contains papillae:
- **Filiform**
   - shaped like cones 
   - located over entire surface
- **Fungiform**
   - shaped like mushrooms
   - found on sides &amp; tip
- **Foliate** 
   - series of folds
   - back &amp; sides
- **Circumvilliate**
   - shaped like flat mounds 
   - in a trench located at back

Figure 15.2 (a) The tongue, showing the four different types of papillae. (b) A fungiform papilla on the tongue; each papilla contains a number of taste buds. (c) Cross section of a taste bud showing the taste pore where the taste stimulus enters. (d) The taste cell; the tip of the taste cell is positioned just under the pore. (e) Close-up of the membrane at the tip of the taste cell, showing the receptor sites for bitter, sweet, sour, and salty substances. Stimulation of these receptor sites, as described in the text, triggers a number of different reactions within the cell (not shown) that lead to movement of charged molecules across the membrane, which creates an electrical signal in the receptor.

Taste buds are located in papillae except for filiform.
- Tongue: contains ~ 10,000 taste buds.
- A taste bud has 50-100 taste cells with tips that extend into the taste pore.
- **Transduction** occurs when chemicals contact the receptor sites on the tips.

# Structure of the Taste System


Taste signals travel several pathways.
  
- **Chorda tympani nerve**
   -  from front and sides of tongue
- **Glossopharyngeal nerve**
   - from back of tongue
- **Vagus nerve**
   - from mouth and throat
- **Superficial petronasal nerve**
   - from soft palate  
  
Gustatory pathways travel to:
- **Nucleus of the solitary tract** (spinal cord)
- **Thalamus**  
Followed by areas in the frontal lobe:
- **Gustatory Cortex** (Insula)
- **Frontal opervulum cortex**
- **Orbital frontal cortex**

Figure 15.4 The central pathway for taste signals, showing the nucleus of the solitary tract, where nerve fibers from the tongue and the mouth synapse in the medulla at the base of the brain. From the nucleus of the solitary tract, these fibers synapse in the thalamus and then the insula and frontal operculum, which are the cortical areas for taste.

# The Neural Code for Taste Quality
![:hline]()
### Critique the evidence for specificity vs. distributed coding in taste.


---

# Specificity Coding
- Experiment by Mueller et al.
    - Genetic cloning was used to determine if mice could be created that possessed a human receptor that responds to PTC.
    - Normally, mice don't have this receptor or respond to this substance.
    - Experiment was successful, but not all data show same results.

![](fig_15_t2.png)

???

---

# Specificity Coding
.pull-left[
- Applying amiloride to the tongue blocks flow of sodium to taste receptors.
    - Causes decrease in the responding of neurons in rat's brainstem that respond to salt, but not to those that respond to salty and bitter.
]
.pull-right[
![](fig_15_8.png)
]

???

Figure 15.8 The blue dashed lines show how two neurons in the rat’s nucleus of the solitary tract respond to a number of different taste stimuli (along the horizontal axis). The neuron in (a) responds strongly to compounds associated with salty tastes. The neuron in (b) responds to a wide range of compounds. The purple lines show how these two neurons fire after the sodium-blocker amiloride is applied to the tongue. This compound inhibits the responses of the neuron that responds to salt (a) but has little effect on neuron (b).


---

# Specificity Coding
- Evidence exists for both specificity and population coding but balance is shifting toward specificity.
- Some researchers suggest that the neural system for taste may function like the visual system for color (e.g., Trichromatic Theory).
- Currently, there is no agreed upon explanation for the neural system for taste.

---

# Individual Differences in Taste
Different responses to phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) and to 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP):
- Tasters, nontasters, and supertasters
- Tasters have more taste buds than nontasters.
- Tasters have specialized receptors for these compounds.
- Supertasters appear more sensitive to bitter substances than tasters.

# Functions of Olfaction
![:hline]()
### .font70[Describe how anosmia demonstrates the importance of olfaction, and how odor detection thresholds are measured.]


---

# The Functions of Olfaction
.pull-left[
Many animals are macrosmatic: having a keen sense of smell that is necessary for survival  
- Humans are microsmatic: a less keen sense of smell that is not crucial to survival
- Rats are 8 to 50 times more sensitive to odors than humans. 
- Dogs are 300 to 10,000 times more sensitive.
  
However, individual receptors for all of these animals are equally sensitive.
- The difference lies in the number of receptors they each have.
- Humans have ten million and dogs have one billion olfactory receptors.
]

# Detecting Odors

### Measuring the detection threshold
**Yes/no** procedure: 
- Trials with odors along with "blank" trials
- Yes or No response
- Bias in terms of when the participant decides to respond
  
**Forced-choice**
- 2 trial types: with or without odorant
- Participant indicates which smells strongest

Figure 15.11 Hundreds of molecules from the coffee, orange juice, and bacon are mixed together in the air, but the person just perceives “coffee,” “orange juice,” and “bacon.” This perception of three odor objects from hundreds of intermixed molecules is a feat of perceptual organization.

# The Puzzle of Olfactory Quality
.pull-left[
- Researchers have found it difficult to map perceptual experience onto physical attributes of odorants.
    - There is no specific language for odor quality.
    - Some molecules that have similar structure smell different, and some that have different structures smell the same.
- Links have been found between the structure of molecules, olfactory quality, and patterns of activation in the olfactory system.

Figure 15.24 Flavor is created by interactions among taste, olfaction, vision, and touch. The olfactory pathway (blue) and taste pathway (red) interact as signals are sent between these two pathways. in addition, both taste and olfactory pathways send signals to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), signals from touch are sent to the taste pathway and the OFC, and signals from vision are sent to the OFC. Also shown are the amygdala—which is responsible for emotional responses and has many connections to structures in both the taste and olfaction pathways and also receives signals from vision—and the hypothalamus, which is involved in determining hunger.
