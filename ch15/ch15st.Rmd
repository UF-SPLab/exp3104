## The Function of Chemical Senses
- "Gatekeepers" of the body: 
    - Identify things that should be consumed for survival
    - Detect things that would be harmful and should be rejected
    - Cause good and bad affective responses

---

## Basic Taste Qualities
.pull-left[
- Five basic taste qualities
    - Salty
    - Sour
    - Sweet
    - Bitter
    - Umami: described as meaty, brothy or savory, and associated with MSG

### Connections Between Taste Quality & a Substance's Effect
.pull-left[
- Sweetness is usually associated with substances that have nutritive value.
- Bitter is usually associated with substances that are potentially harmful.
- Salty taste indicates the presence of sodium.
- However, there is not a perfect connection between tastes and function of substances.

## Structure of the Taste System

.pull-left[
- Tongue contains papillae
    - Filiform: shaped like cones and located over entire surface
    - Fungiform: shaped like mushrooms and found on sides and tip
    - Foliate: series of folds on back and sides
    - Circumvilliate: shaped like flat mounds in a trench located at back

(c) Cross section of a taste bud showing the taste pore where the taste stimulus enters. (d) The taste cell; the tip of the taste cell is positioned just under the pore. (e) Close-up of the membrane at the tip of the taste cell, showing the receptor sites for bitter, sweet, sour, and salty substances. Stimulation of these receptor sites, as described in the text, triggers a number of different reactions within the cell (not shown) that lead to movement of charged molecules across the membrane, which creates an electrical signal in the receptor.

## Structure of the Taste System

![](fig_15_t1.png)

---

## Structure of the Taste System
.pull-left[
- Taste buds are located in papillae except for filiform.
    - Tongue contains approximately 10,000 taste buds.
    - Each taste bud has 50-100 taste cells with tips that extend into the taste pore.
    - Transduction occurs when chemicals contact the receptor sites on the tips.

- Signals from taste cells travel along a set of pathways.
    - Chorda tympani nerve from front and sides of tongue
    - Glossopharyngeal nerve from back of tongue
    - Vagus nerve from mouth and throat
    - Superficial petronasal nerve from soft palate

# The Neural Code for Taste Quality
#### Critique the evidence for specificity vs. distributed coding in taste.
]
]

---

## Population Coding

.pull-left[
- Experiment by Erickson
    - Different taste stimuli were presented to rats, and recordings were made from the chorda tympani.
    - Across-fiber patterns showed that two substances (ammonium chloride and potassium chloride) are similar to each other but different from sodium chloride.

]

???

Figure 15.5 Across-fiber patterns of the response of fibers in the rat’s chorda tympani nerve to three salts. each letter on the horizontal axis indicates a different single fiber. 

---

## Specificity Coding
- Experiment by Mueller et al.
    - Genetic cloning was used to determine if mice could be created that possessed a human receptor that responds to PTC.
    - Normally, mice don't have this receptor or respond to this substance.
    - Experiment was successful, but not all data show same results.

![](fig_15_t2.png)

???

---

## Specificity Coding
.pull-left[
- Applying amiloride to the tongue blocks flow of sodium to taste receptors.
    - Causes decrease in the responding of neurons in rat's brainstem that respond to salt, but not to those that respond to salty and bitter.
]
.pull-right[
![](fig_15_8.png)
]

???

Figure 15.8 The blue dashed lines show how two neurons in the rat’s nucleus of the solitary tract respond to a number of different taste stimuli (along the horizontal axis). The neuron in (a) responds strongly to compounds associated with salty tastes. The neuron in (b) responds to a wide range of compounds. The purple lines show how these two neurons fire after the sodium-blocker amiloride is applied to the tongue. This compound inhibits the responses of the neuron that responds to salt (a) but has little effect on neuron (b).


---

## Specificity Coding
- Evidence exists for both specificity and population coding but balance is shifting toward specificity.
- Some researchers suggest that the neural system for taste may function like the visual system for color (e.g., Trichromatic Theory).
- Currently, there is no agreed upon explanation for the neural system for taste.

---

## Individual Differences in Taste
- There are different responses to phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) and to 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP):
    - Tasters, nontasters, and supertasters
    - Tasters have more taste buds than nontasters.
    - Tasters have specialized receptors for these compounds.
    - Supertasters appear more sensitive to bitter substances than tasters.

# Olfaction & Flavor
## The Functions of Olfaction
#### Describe how anosmia demonstrates the importance of olfaction, and how odor detection thresholds are measured.

]
]

---

## The Functions of Olfaction
- Many animals are macrosmatic: having a keen sense of smell that is necessary for survival  
- Humans are microsmatic: a less keen sense of smell that is not crucial to survival
- Singh and Bronstad: showed a relationship between men's rating of women's body odors and the women's menstrual cycle

---

## Detecting Odors
- Measuring the detection threshold
    - Yes/no procedure: participants are given trials with odors along with "blank" trials.
- They respond by saying yes or no.
- This can result in bias in terms of when the participant decides to respond.
    - Forced-choice: two trials are given, one with odorant and one without.
- Participant indicates which smells strongest.

???

Forced-choice: strongest/greater smell

---

## Detecting Odors
- Rats are 8 to 50 times more sensitive to odors than humans. 
- Dogs are 300 to 10,000 times more sensitive.
- However, individual receptors for all of these animals are equally sensitive.
- The difference lies in the number of receptors they each have.
    - Humans have ten million and dogs have one billion olfactory receptors.

## The Puzzle of Olfactory Quality
.pull-left[
- Researchers have found it difficult to map perceptual experience onto physical attributes of odorants.
    - There is no specific language for odor quality.
    - Some molecules that have similar structure smell different, and some that have different structures smell the same.
- Links have been found between the structure of molecules, olfactory quality, and patterns of activation in the olfactory system.

Figure 15.11 Hundreds of molecules from the coffee, orange juice, and bacon are mixed together in the air, but the person just perceives “coffee,” “orange juice,” and “bacon.” This perception of three odor objects from hundreds of intermixed molecules is a feat of perceptual organization.

## The Olfactory Mucosa
.pull-left[
- Olfactory mucosa is located at the top of the nasal cavity.
    - Odorants are carried along the mucosa coming in contact with the olfactory receptor neurons (ORN).
    - These neurons contain molecules called olfactory receptors.
    - Humans have about 350 types of receptors.

- (c) Stimulation of receptors in the OrNs 
- (d) activates the OrNs. Three types of OrNs are shown here, indicated by different colors. each type has its own specialized receptors. 
- (e) Signals from the OrNs are then sent to glomeruli in the olfactory bulb,

## Representing Odors in the Cortex
- Signals from the olfactory bulb are sent to: 
    - Primary olfactory (piriform) cortex in the temporal lobe and amygdala
- Amygdala plays a role in emotional reactions to odors.
    - Then to secondary olfactory (orbitofrontal) cortex in the frontal lobe

## How Odor Objects Are Represented
- Experiment by Wilson
    - Measured response of neurons in the rat's piriform cortex to two odorants
- A mixture: isoamyl acetate and peppermint
- A compound: isoamyl acetate alone
    - Results showed that with enough exposure, the piriform cortex could discriminate between the mixture and the compound.

## The Perception of Flavor
.pull-left[
- Combination of smell, taste, and other sensations (such as burning of hot peppers)
- Odor stimuli from food in the mouth reaches the olfactory mucosa through the retronasal route.
- The taste of most compounds is influenced by olfaction, but a few, such as MSG are not.

## Taste and Olfaction Meet in the Nervous System

![](fig_15_24.png)

Figure 15.24 Flavor is created by interactions among taste, olfaction, vision, and touch. The olfactory pathway (blue) and taste pathway (red) interact as signals are sent between these two pathways. in addition, both taste and olfactory pathways send signals to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), signals from touch are sent to the taste pathway and the OFC, and signals from vision are sent to the OFC. Also shown are the amygdala—which is responsible for emotional responses and has many connections to structures in both the taste and olfaction pathways and also receives signals from vision—and the hypothalamus, which is involved in determining hunger.
