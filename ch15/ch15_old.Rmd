The Chemical Senses
The Function of Chemical Senses
‚ÄúGatekeepers‚Äù of the body:
Identify things that should be consumed for survival
Detect things that would be harmful and should be rejected
Cause good and bad affective responses

Basic Taste Qualities
Five basic taste qualities
Salty
Sour
Sweet
Bitter
Umami: described as meaty, brothy or savory, and associated with MSG
Basic Taste Qualities (cont'd.)


Connections Between Taste Quality and a Substance‚Äôs Effect
Sweetness is usually associated with substances that have nutritive value.
Bitter is usually associated with substances that are potentially harmful.
Salty taste indicates the presence of sodium.
However, there is not a perfect connection between tastes and function of substances.
Structure of the Taste System
Tongue contains papillae
Filiform: shaped like cones and located over entire surface
Fungiform: shaped like mushrooms and found on sides and tip
Foliate: series of folds on back and sides
Circumvilliate: shaped like flat mounds in a trench located at back
Structure of the Taste System (cont'd.)


Structure of the Taste System (cont'd.)


Structure of the Taste System (cont'd.)
Taste buds are located in papillae except for filiform.
Tongue contains approximately 10,000 taste buds.
Each taste bud has 50-100 taste cells with tips that extend into the taste pore.
Transduction occurs when chemicals contact the receptor sites on the tips.
Structure of the Taste System (cont'd.)


Structure of the Taste System (cont'd.)


Structure of the Taste System (cont'd.)
Signals from taste cells travel along a set of pathways.
Chorda tympani nerve from front and sides of tongue
Glossopharyngeal nerve from back of tongue
Vagus nerve from mouth and throat
Superficial petronasal nerve from soft palate
Structure of the Taste System (cont'd.)
These pathways make connections in the nucleus of the solitary tract in the spinal cord.
Then, they travel to the thalamus.
Followed by areas in the frontal lobe:
Insula
Frontal opervulum cortex
Orbital frontal cortex
Population Coding
Experiment by Erickson
Different taste stimuli were presented to rats, and recordings were made from the chorda tympani.
Across-fiber patterns showed that two substances (ammonium chloride and potassium chloride) are similar to each other but different from sodium chloride.
Population Coding (cont'd.)
Specificity Coding
Experiment by Mueller et al.
Genetic cloning was used to determine if mice could be created that possessed a human receptor that responds to PTC.
Normally, mice don‚Äôt have this receptor or respond to this substance.
The experiment was successful, but not all data show the same results.
Specificity Coding (cont'd.)


Specificity Coding (cont'd.)
Applying amiloride to the tongue blocks flow of sodium to taste receptors.
Causes decrease in the responding of neurons in rat‚Äôs brainstem that respond to salt, but not to those that respond to salty and bitter.
Specificity Coding (cont'd.)
Specificity Coding (cont'd.)
Evidence exists for both specificity and population coding but balance is shifting toward specificity.
Some researchers suggest that the neural system for taste may function like the visual system for color.
Currently, there is no agreed upon explanation for the neural system for taste.
Individual Differences in Taste
There are different responses to phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) and to 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP):
Tasters, nontasters, and supertasters
Tasters have more taste buds than nontasters.
Tasters have specialized receptors for these compounds.
Supertasters appear more sensitive to bitter substances than tasters.
The Functions of Olfaction
Many animals are macrosmatic: having a keen sense of smell that is necessary for survival
Humans are microsmatic: a less keen sense of smell that is not crucial to survival
Singh and Bronstad: showed a relationship between men‚Äôs rating of women‚Äôs body odors and the women‚Äôs menstrual cycle
Detecting Odors
Measuring the detection threshold
Yes/no procedure: participants are given trials with odors along with ‚Äúblank‚Äù trials.
They respond by saying yes or no.
This can result in bias in terms of when the participant decides to respond.
Forced-choice: two trials are given, one with odorant and one without.
Participant indicates which smells strongest.
Detecting Odors (cont'd.)
Rats are 8 to 50 times more sensitive to odors than humans.
Dogs are 300 to 10,000 times more sensitive.
However, individual receptors for all of these animals are equally sensitive.
The difference lies in the number of receptors they each have.
Humans have ten million and dogs have one billion olfactory receptors.
Detecting Odors (cont'd.)


Identifying Odors
Humans can discriminate more than one trillion different odors.
Find it difficult to identify odors
Only successful half of the time
The Puzzle of Olfactory Quality
Researchers have found it difficult to map perceptual experience onto physical attributes of odorants.
There is no specific language for odor quality.
Some molecules that have similar structure smell different, and some that have different structures smell the same.
Links have been found between the structure of molecules, olfactory quality, and patterns of activation in the olfactory system.

The Puzzle of Olfactory Quality (cont'd.)


The Puzzle of Olfactory Quality (cont'd.)


The Olfactory Mucosa
Olfactory mucosa is located at the top of the nasal cavity.
Odorants are carried along the mucosa coming in contact with the olfactory receptor neurons (ORN).
These neurons contain molecules called olfactory receptors.
Humans have about 350 types of receptors that each have a protein that crosses the membrane seven times.
The Olfactory Mucosa (cont'd.)


How Olfactory Receptor Neurons Respond to Odorants
Calcium imaging method
Concentration of calcium increases inside the ORN when an olfactory receptor responds.
Calcium can be detected by using a chemical that makes the neuron fluoresce.
Measuring the decrease in fluorescence indicates the strength of the response.
How Olfactory Receptor Neurons Respond to Odorants (cont'd.)
Combinatorial code for odor
Proposed by Malnic et al. from results of calcium imaging experiments
Odorants are coded by patterns of activation of olfactory receptors called recognition profiles.
Molecules that have similar structures but smell different have different recognition profiles.

The Search for Order in the Olfactory Bulb
Signals are carried to the glomeruli in the olfactory bulb.
ORNs of a particular type send their signals to one or two glomeruli.
Two techniques have been used to determine how the glomeruli respond to different odorants.
Optical imaging method
2-deoxyglucose (2DG) technique

The Search for Order in the Olfactory Bulb (cont'd.)



The Search for Order in the Olfactory Bulb (cont'd.)
Optical imaging method
Cortical cells consume oxygen when activated.
Red light is used to determine the amount of oxygen in the cells.
Less oxygen reflects less red light.
Measuring the amount of light reflected reveals which areas of cortex are most active.
The Search for Order in the Olfactory Bulb (cont'd.)
2-deoxyglucose (2DG) technique
2DG, which contains glucose, is injected into an animal.
Animal is exposed to different chemicals.
Neural activation is measured by amount of radioactivity present.
This technique, used with behavioral testing, shows the pattern of neural activation is related to both chemical structure and to perception.
The Search for Order in the Olfactory Bulb (cont'd.)



Representing Odors in the Cortex
Signals from the olfactory bulb are sent to:
Primary olfactory (piriform) cortex in the temporal lobe and amygdala
Amygdala plays a role in emotional reactions to odors.
Then to secondary olfactory (orbitofrontal) cortex in the frontal lobe


Representing Odors in the Cortex (cont'd.)




How Odorants Are Represented in the Piriform Cortex
Experiment by Rennaker
Used multiple electrodes to measure neural responding in the piriform cortex and found that isoamyl acetate causes activation across the cortex

How Odorants Are Represented in the Piriform Cortex (cont'd.)



How Odor Objects Are Represented
Experiment by Wilson
Measured response of neurons in the rat‚Äôs piriform cortex to two odorants
A mixture: isoamyl acetate and peppermint
A compound: isoamyl acetate alone
Results showed that with enough exposure, the piriform cortex could discriminate between the mixture and the compound.
How Odor Objects Are Represented (cont'd.)


The Perception of Flavor
Combination of smell, taste, and other sensations (such as burning of hot peppers)
Odor stimuli from food in the mouth reaches the olfactory mucosa through the retronasal route.
The taste of most compounds is influenced by olfaction, but a few, such as MSG are not.

The Perception of Flavor (cont'd.)



Taste and Olfaction Meet in the Nervous System
Responses from taste and smell are first combined in the orbital frontal cortex (OFC).
Interactions between taste, olfaction, vision and touch underscore multimodal nature of our experience of flavor.
What are bimodal neurons?

Flavor Is Influenced by Cognitive Factors
Plassmann experiment
Judging taste pleasantness of wine
The higher the price of the wine label, the more pleasant the rating
Flavor Is Influenced by Cognitive Factors (cont'd.)


Flavor Is Influenced by Food Intake: Sensory-Specific Satiety
O‚ÄôDoherty experiment
Both the pleasantness of a food-related odor and the brain‚Äôs response to an odor can be influenced by satiety.


Flavor Is Influenced by Food Intake: Sensory-Specific Satiety (cont'd.)




The Proust Effect: Memories, Emotions, and Smell
Smell can induce memory recall.
Proust effect: the ability of taste and olfaction to unlock memories


Infant Chemical Sensitivity
The question is ‚Äì do newborn infants perceive odors and tastes?
Steiner found that newborns can smell and discriminate between different olfactory stimuli.
Newborns can discriminate sweet, sour, and bitter stimuli
Mennella experiment: used combination of carrot juice and water to study infant preferences
