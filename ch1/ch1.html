# The Perceptual Process



???

Figure 1.1 The perceptual process. These seven steps, plus “knowledge” inside the person’s brain, summarize the major events 
that occur between the time a person looks at the stimulus in the environment (the tree in this example) and perceives the tree, 
recognizes it, and takes action toward it. 


---


# .font80[Distal and Proximal Stimuli (Steps 1 and 2)]

- Distal Stimulus
    - Environmental stimulus are all objects in the environment are available to the observer.
    - Observer selectively attends to objects.
    - Stimulus impinges on receptors resulting in internal representation.


---


# .font80[Steps 1 and 2 of the Perceptual Process]

![:image 85%](fig_1_3.png)

???

Figure 1.3 Steps 1 and 2 of the perceptual process. Step 1: Information about the tree (the distal stimulus) is carried by light. Step 2: The light is transformed when it is reflected from the tree, when it travels through the atmosphere, and when it is focused by the eye’s optical system. The result is the proximal stimulus, the image of the tree on the retina, which is a representation of the tree. 


---

# Steps 1 and 2 of the Perceptual Process
- Principle of transformation
    - When the stimuli and responses created by stimuli are transformed, or changed, between the environmental stimuli and perception.

# Receptor Processes (Step 3)
- The process
    - Sensory receptors are cells specialized to respond to environmental energy
    - Visual pigment is what reacts to light
    - **Transduction** occurs, which changes environmental energy to nerve impulses

![:positionImage 33%, 20%, 0deg, 80%](fig_1_4.png)


???

Figure 1.4 Step 3 of the perceptual process.  Receptor processes include transduction (the transformation of light energy into electrical energy) and the shaping of perception by the properties of visual pigments in the receptor’s outer segments. The end result is an electrical representation of the tree.


---

# Neural Processing (Step 4)
- The process
    - Neural processing: changes that occur as signals are transmitted through the maze of neurons
- Primary receiving area
    - Occipital lobe
    - Temporal lobe
    - Parietal lobe


![:positionImage 32%, 27.5%, 0deg, 95%](fig_1_5.png)

???

Figure 1.5 Step 4 of the perceptual process. Neural processing involves interactions between the electrical signals traveling in networks of neurons early in the system, in the retina; later, on the pathway to the brain; and finally, within the brain.

---

# .font80[Behavioral Responses (Step 5-7)]

- Experience and Action
    - Electrical signals are transformed into conscious experience.
    - Person perceives object (such as a tree).
    - Person recognizes it as a tree (places object in category).


![:positionImage 35%, 10%, 0deg, 100%](fig_1_6.png)

???

Figure 1.6 Steps 5–7 of the perceptual process. The behavioral responses: perception, recognition, and action.

# Knowledge

- Knowledge is any information the perceiver brings to a situation.

--

**Bottom-up** processing
- Processing based on incoming stimuli from the environment
- Also called data-based processing

--

**Top-down** processing
- Processing based on the perceiver’s previous knowledge (cognitive factors)
- Also called knowledge-based processing

---

# Knowledge

After looking at the drawing in Figure 1.7, close your eyes, turn to the next slide, and open and shut your eyes rapidly to briefly expose the picture in Figure 1.11. Decide what the picture is; then open your eyes and read the explanation below it. Do this now, before reading further.

Figure 1.11 Did you see a “rat” or a “man”? Looking at the more ratlike picture in Figure 1.7 increased the chances that you would 
see this one as a rat. But if you had first seen the man version, you would have been more likely to perceive this figure as a man.

# Knowledge

![:image 95%](fig_1_8.png)

Figure 1.8 Perception is determined by an interaction between bottom-up processing, which starts with the image on the receptors, and top-down processing, which brings the observer’s knowledge into play. In this example, (a) the image of the moth on the woman’s retina initiates bottom-up processing; and (b) her prior knowledge of moths contributes to top-down processing.

Figure 1.13 Furmanski and Engel (2000) made both behavioral and physiological measurements of subjects’ response to oriented gratings. (a) Bars indicate sensitivity to gratings of different orientations. Sensitivity is highest to the vertical (0 degree) and horizontal (90 degree) orientations; (b) Bars indicate fMRI amplitude to different orientations. Amplitudes were greater to the 0- and 90-degree orientations.

- Method of limits
    - Stimuli of different intensities presented in ascending and descending order (staircases)
    - Observer responds to whether she perceived the stimulus
    - Cross-over point is the threshold

# Why is the Difference Between &lt;br/&gt; Physical and Perceptual Important?


???

Figure 1.20 A subject (indicated by the eye) is viewing lights with different physical intensities. The two lights at (b) have twice the physical intensity as the single light at (a). However, when the subject is asked to judge brightness, which is a perceptual judgment, the light at (b) is judged to be only about 20 or 30 percent brighter than the light at (a).

# Summary

#### *What* physical instruments record &amp; *what* we perceive are different

&gt; “If changes in physical stimuli always resulted in similar changes in perception of those stimuli . . . there would be no need for psychology; human perception could be wholly explained by the laws of the discipline of physics” (p. 120)
