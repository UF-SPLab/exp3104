# Grading Policy

![:hline]



- .font125[**60%** of your grade will be determined by exams during normal class hours.]



- .font125[**30%** of your grade will be determined by writing assignments and in class quizzes.]



- .font125[**10%** of your grade will be determined by your attendance and participation in class.]
    - Generally, ask questions and answer them.
    - Don't leave all of the small group activities up to your classmates.



### Make-Up Exam Policy



- .font140[There are **NO** make-ups for missed exams. Don't bother asking.]

---
# Course Policies

**EXAMS**: Throughout the semester there will be four exams; the fourth exam will *NOT* be cumulative. Each exam will consist of a combination of multiple-choice questions, true/false, fill in the blank, and short answer/essay questions. The lowest score out of four will be dropped, and the remaining exams will each comprise 20% of the course grade (i.e., total 60% of course grade). Final grades for the course will be determined by UF undergraduate guidelines: https://catalog.ufl.edu/ugrad/current/regulations/info/grades.aspx

**ASSIGNMENTS &amp; QUIZZES**: Assignments and quizzes during the semester will together comprise 30% of the course grade. The writing assignments and quizzes will be designed to help you apply and understand material from the course text as you read.

**DISCUSSION &amp; PARTICIPATION**: Discussion and participation will account for 10% of the final grade. Attendance will be tracked as part of overall classroom participation. A majority of the participation grade will originate from small-group activities, discussions, and projects during class. (Additional informaiton will be provided early in the semester.) Excused absences are consistent with university policies in the undergraduate catalog (https://catalog.ufl.edu/ugrad/current/regulations/info/attendance.aspx) and require appropriate documentation.

# The Perceptual Process



???

Figure 1.1 The perceptual process. These seven steps, plus “knowledge” inside the person’s brain, summarize the major events 
that occur between the time a person looks at the stimulus in the environment (the tree in this example) and perceives the tree, 
recognizes it, and takes action toward it. 


---


# .font80[Distal and Proximal Stimuli (Steps 1 and 2)]

- Distal Stimulus
    - Environmental stimulus are all objects in the environment are available to the observer.
    - Observer selectively attends to objects.
    - Stimulus impinges on receptors resulting in internal representation.


---


# Steps 1 and 2 of the Perceptual Process

![:image 85%](fig_1_3.png)

???

Figure 1.3 Steps 1 and 2 of the perceptual process. Step 1: Information about the tree (the distal stimulus) is carried by light. Step 2: The light is transformed when it is reflected from the tree, when it travels through the atmosphere, and when it is focused by the eye’s optical system. The result is the proximal stimulus, the image of the tree on the retina, which is a representation of the tree. 


---

# Steps 1 and 2 of the Perceptual Process
- Principle of transformation
    - When the stimuli and responses created by stimuli are transformed, or changed, between the environmental stimuli and perception.

# Receptor Processes (Step 3)
- The process
    - Sensory receptors are cells specialized to respond to environmental energy
    - Visual pigment is what reacts to light
    - **Transduction** occurs, which changes environmental energy to nerve impulses

---

# Receptor Processes (Step 3)

![:image 75%](fig_1_4.png)

???

Figure 1.4 Step 3 of the perceptual process.  Receptor processes include transduction (the transformation of light energy into electrical energy) and the shaping of perception by the properties of visual pigments in the receptor’s outer segments. The end result is an electrical representation of the tree.


---

# Neural Processing (Step 4)
- The process
    - Neural processing: changes that occur as signals are transmitted through the maze of neurons
- Primary receiving area
    - Occipital lobe
    - Temporal lobe
    - Parietal lobe

---

# Neural Processing (Step 4)

![:image 85%](fig_1_5.png)

???

Figure 1.5 Step 4 of the perceptual process. Neural processing involves interactions between the electrical signals traveling in networks of neurons early in the system, in the retina; later, on the pathway to the brain; and finally, within the brain.

---

# Behavioral Responses (Step 5-7)

- Experience and Action
    - Electrical signals are transformed into conscious experience.
    - Person perceives object (such as a tree).
    - Person recognizes it as a tree (places object in category).

---

# Behavioral Responses (Steps 5-7)

![:image 85%](fig_1_6.png)

???

Figure 1.6 Steps 5–7 of the perceptual process. The behavioral responses: perception, recognition, and action. 



---

# Knowledge

- Knowledge is any information the perceiver brings to a situation.



**Bottom-up** processing
- Processing based on incoming stimuli from the environment
- Also called data-based processing



**Top-down** processing
- Processing based on the perceiver’s previous knowledge (cognitive factors)
- Also called knowledge-based processing

---

# Knowledge

![:image 70%](fig_1_7.png)

???

After looking at the drawing in Figure 1.7, close your eyes, turn to the next slide, and open and shut your eyes rapidly to briefly expose the picture in Figure 1.11. Decide what the picture is; then open your eyes and read the explanation below it. Do this now, before reading further.

---

# Knowledge


![](fig_1_11.png)

???

Figure 1.11 Did you see a “rat” or a “man”? Looking at the more ratlike picture in Figure 1.7 increased the chances that you would 
see this one as a rat. But if you had first seen the man version, you would have been more likely to perceive this figure as a man.

---

# Knowledge

![:image 95%](fig_1_8.png)

???

Figure 1.8 Perception is determined by an interaction between bottom-up processing, which starts with the image on the receptors, and top-down processing, which brings the observer’s knowledge into play. In this example, (a) the image of the moth on the woman’s retina initiates bottom-up processing; and (b) her prior knowledge of moths contributes to top-down processing.

Figure 1.10 Measuring grating acuity. The finest line width at which a subject can perceive the bars in a black-and-white grating stimulus is that subject’s grating acuity. Stimuli with different line widths are presented one at a time, and the subject indicates the grating’s orientation until the lines are so close together that the subject can no longer indicate the orientation.

# The Two “Stimulus” Relationships (A and B)

![:image 60%](fig_1_12.png)

Figure 1.12 Coppola and coworkers (1998) measured the relationship between bar orientation (stimuli) and brain activity (physiology) in ferrets. Verticals and horizontals generated the greatest brain activity. 

---

# The Physiology—Perception Relationship (C)

![:image 50%](fig_1_13.png)

???

Figure 1.13 Furmanski and Engel (2000) made both behavioral and physiological measurements of subjects’ response to oriented gratings. (a) Bars indicate sensitivity to gratings of different orientations. Sensitivity is highest to the vertical (0 degree) and horizontal (90 degree) orientations; (b) Bars indicate fMRI amplitude to different orientations. Amplitudes were greater to the 0- and 90-degree orientations.

### Define “absolute threshold” and “difference threshold.”



### Describe the methods used in method of limits and magnitude estimation studies.

# Measuring Perception

#### **Absolute threshold**: smallest amount of energy needed to detect a stimulus

- Method of limits
    - Stimuli of different intensities presented in ascending and descending order
    - Observer responds to whether she perceived the stimulus
    - Cross-over point is the threshold

---

# Measuring Perception

![:image 50%](fig_1_15.png)

Figure 1.16 (a) How a dark scene might be perceived when seen just after being in the light. (b) How the scene would be perceived after spending 10 to 15 minutes adapting to the dark. The improvement in perception after spending some time in the dark reflects a decrease in the threshold for seeing light.

# Five Questions About the Perceptual World

#### What is the *perceptual* magnitude of a stimulus?
- Magnitude estimation



#### What is the *identity* of the stimulus?
- Recognition testing



#### How can I *quickly* react to it?
- Reaction time



#### How can I *describe* what it out there?
- Phenomenological report



#### How can I *interact* with it?
- Physical tasks and judgments


---

# What is the *Identity* of the Stimulus?

![:image 50%](fig_1_17.png)

???

Figure 1.17 A stimulus like those used in an experiment in which subjects are asked to recognize a rapidly flashed scene. Subjects can often recognize general properties of a rapidly flashed scene, such as “houses near water and a boat,” but need more time to perceive the details. 

---

# How *Quickly* Can I React to It?

![:image 50%](fig_1_18.png)

???

Figure 1.18 (a) A reaction time experiment in which the subject is told to look at the + sign, but pay attention to the location at A, and to push a button as quickly as possible when a dark target flashes anywhere on the display. (b) Reaction times in milliseconds, which indicates that reaction time was faster when the target was flashed at A, where the subject was attending, than when it was flashed at B, where the subject was not attending.

# Why is the Difference Between &lt;br/&gt; Physical and Perceptual Important?


???

Figure 1.20 A subject (indicated by the eye) is viewing lights with different physical intensities. The two lights at (b) have twice the physical intensity as the single light at (a). However, when the subject is asked to judge brightness, which is a perceptual judgment, the light at (b) is judged to be only about 20 or 30 percent brighter than the light at (a).

# The Electromagnetic Spectrum


![:image 90%](fig_1_21.png)

???

- stretches from gamma rays to AC circuits. 
- The visible spectrum, shown exploded below, accounts for only a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
- We are blind to energy outside of the visible spectrum. 

the small range within spectrum that we can see. wavelength in nanometers (nm), where 1 nm = 10–9 meters.
microwave 5cm; 89.1 MHz FM (VHF) FM is ~11ft

# Summary

#### *What* physical instruments record &amp; *what* we perceive are different

&gt; “If changes in physical stimuli always resulted in similar changes in perception of those stimuli . . . there would be no need for psychology; human perception could be wholly explained by the laws of the discipline of physics” (p. 120)
