# Scanning a Scene
![:hline]()
### Define attention and explain why attention is necessary.
### Identify the factors that determine where a person looks in </br> a visual scene with supporting examples from research studies.
### Describe Posner et al.’s (1978) precueing task and what it revealed about attention.

---

# Scanning a Scene
- Visual scanning - looking from place to place
    - Fixation
    - Saccadic eye movement
- Overt attention involves looking directly at the attended object.
- Covert attention refers to attention without looking.

# What Directs Our Attention?

.pull-left[

- Characteristics of the scene:
    - Visual salience: areas of stimuli that attract attention due to their properties
    - Color, contrast, and orientation are relevant properties.
- Attentional capture

---

# Cognitive Factors
- Picture meaning and observer knowledge
    - Scene schema: prior knowledge about what is found in typical scenes
- Fixations are influenced by this knowledge.

---

# Cognitive Factors
- Experiment by Shinoda et al.
    - Observers' fixations were measured during computer simulated driving.
- They were more likely to detect stop signs when they were at intersections.
- They have learned that this is where stop signs are typically placed.

---

# Cognitive Factors

- One way to show that where we look isn't determined only by saliency is by checking the eye movements of the subject.
    - Meaning likely has attracted attention
- Attention can be influenced by a person's goals.

Figure 6.7 Yarbus (1967) asked subjects to view the painting in (a) and recorded their eye movements while they had to (b) estimate the ages of the people, (c) remember the clothes worn by the people, or (d) remember the positions of all the people and objects in the room. The figure shows data collected by James Brockmole using Yarbus’ original procedures combined with modern eye tracking technology. Results show that subjects’ eye movements are strongly influenced by the task

    - Stimuli appeared that were consistent (valid trial) or inconsistent (invalid trial) with the cue.

# Attention and Experiencing a Coherent World  
![:hline]()
### Describe the link between neural responding and attention.  
  

---

# .font60[Attention and Experiencing a Coherent World]

- Binding: process by which features are combined to create perception of coherent objects
- Binding problem: features of objects are processed separately in different areas of the brain
- So, how does binding occur?

![](fig_6_18.png)

???

Figure 6.18 Any stimulus, even one as simple as a rolling ball, activates a number of different areas of the cortex. Binding is the process by which these separated signals are combined to create a unified perception.


---

# Feature Integration Theory
- Preattentive stage: features of objects are separated.
- Focused attention stage: features are bound into a coherent perception.

# What Happens When We Don't Attend?
- Inattentional blindness
    - Subjects can be unaware of clearly visible stimuli if they aren't directing their attention to them.

# Inattentional Blindness



![](fig_6_23.png)

Figure 6.23 Inattentional blindness experiment. (a) The cross display is presented for five trials. One arm of the cross is slightly longer on each trial. The subject’s task is to indicate which arm (horizontal or vertical) is longer. (b) On the sixth trial, the subjects carry out the same task, but a small square is included in the display. After the sixth trial, subjects are asked if they saw anything different than before. 



---

# Change Blindness
- Observers were shown a picture with and without a missing element in an alternating fashion with a blank screen.
- Results showed that the pictures had to alternate a number of times before the change was detected.
- When a cue is added to show where to attend, observers noticed change more quickly.

---

# Change Blindness
- Change blindness also occurs for film shots.
- People are "blind" to the fact that they experience change blindness.
- Real objects in the environment change with some type of movement, which is why we normally don't experience change blindness.

Figure 6.29 The rationale for the idea that (a) low-load tasks that use few cognitive resources may leave resources available for processing unattended task-irrelevant stimuli, whereas (b) high-load tasks that use all of a person’s cognitive resources don’t leave any resources to process unattended task-irrelevant stimuli.
