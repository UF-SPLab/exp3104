# Scanning a Scene
![:hline]()
### Define attention and explain why attention is necessary.
### Identify the factors that determine where a person looks in </br> a visual scene with supporting examples from research studies.
### Describe Posner et al.’s (1978) precueing task and what it revealed about attention.

---

# Scanning a Scene
- Visual scanning - looking from place to place
    - Fixation
    - Saccadic eye movement
- Overt attention involves looking directly at the attended object.
- Covert attention refers to attention without looking.

# Cognitive Factors
- Picture meaning and observer knowledge
    - Scene schema: prior knowledge about what is found in typical scenes
- Fixations are influenced by this knowledge.

---

# Cognitive Factors
- Experiment by Shinoda et al.
    - Observers' fixations were measured during computer simulated driving.
- They were more likely to detect stop signs when they were at intersections.
- They have learned that this is where stop signs are typically placed.

# Cognitive Factors

- One way to show that where we look isn't determined only by saliency is by checking the eye movements of the subject.
    - Meaning likely has attracted attention
- Attention can be influenced by a person's goals.

The figure shows data collected by James Brockmole using Yarbus’ original procedures combined with modern eye tracking technology.

# Attention Can Influence Appearance

Experiment by Carrasco et al.
- Observers saw two grating stimuli with similar or different contrast between bars.
- Task: fixate center point, then indicate orientation with higher contrast.
    - Small dot was flashed very quickly on one side before gratings appeared.

![](fig_6_13.png)

???

Figure 6.13 Procedure for Carrasco and coworkers’ (2004) experiment. See text for explanation.


--

- Carrasco results:
    - When there was a large difference in contrast, the dot had no effect.
    - When the contrast was the same, observers were more likely to report that the grating preceded by the dot had higher contrast.
    - Thus, the shift of attention led to an effect on perception.

Figure 6.15 (a) Subjects in Datta and DeYoe’s (2009) experiment directed their attention to different areas of this circular display while keeping their eyes fixed on the center of the display. (b) Activation of the brain that occurred when the subjects attended to the areas indicated by the letters on the stimulus disc. The center of each circle is the place on the brain that corresponds to the center of the stimulus. The yellow “hot spot” is the area of the brain that is maximally activated by attention. 

(a–c) Receptive field (RF) profiles when attention was directed inside the RF, to stimulus S1 (a) or S2 (c), or when attention was directed outside the RF, to S3 (b). The surface color at each point in the plots indicates the increase in the neuron's response elicited by the presentation of a probe stimulus at that position, over the response observed in the absence of a probe (that is, when only S1 and S2 were present). Supplementary Fig. 1 online shows the same data as absolute firing rates. (d) Difference map, computed by subtracting the RF when attention was on S1 from the RF when attention was on S2. The map illustrates that shifting attention from S1 to S2 enhances responsiveness around S2 and reduces it near S1.

# .font60[Attention and Experiencing a Coherent World]

- Binding: process by which features are combined to create perception of coherent objects
- Binding problem: features of objects are processed separately in different areas of the brain
- So, how does binding occur?

- Focused attention stage: features are bound into a coherent perception.

    - Task was to report numbers first followed by shapes at four locations.

  - Triesman & Schmidt results:
  - Incorrect associations of features with objects occurred 18% of the time.
- Asking observers to focus on the target objects eliminated this effect.

The subject’s task is to indicate which arm (horizontal or vertical) is longer. (b) On the sixth trial, the subjects carry out the same task, but a small square is included in the display. After the sixth trial, subjects are asked if they saw anything different than before.

# Change Blindness
- Observers were shown a picture with and without a missing element in an alternating fashion with a blank screen.
- Results showed that the pictures had to alternate a number of times before the change was detected.
- When a cue is added to show where to attend, observers noticed change more quickly.

---

# Change Blindness
- Change blindness also occurs for film shots.
- People are "blind" to the fact that they experience change blindness.
- Real objects in the environment change with some type of movement, which is why we normally don't experience change blindness.
