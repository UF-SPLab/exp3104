# The Ecological Approach to Perception

.pull-left[
Approach developed by J. J. Gibson (began in late 1950s)
- Gibson felt that traditional laboratory research on perception was:
    - Too artificial- observers were not allowed to move their heads.
    - Unable to provide an explanation for how pilots used environmental information to land airplanes

# The Ecological Approach to Perception

.pull-left[
- **Optic flow**: appearance of objects as the observer moves past them
    - **Gradient of flow**: difference in flow as a function of distance from the observer
    - **Focus of expansion**: point in distance where there is no flow

# Self-Produced Information
- Somersaulting
    - Can be performed by learning a predetermined sequence of moves
    - Thus, will performance be the same with and without vision?
    - Bardy and Laurent found that expert gymnasts performed worse with their eyes closed.
- They use vision to correct their trajectory.
- Novice gymnasts do not show this effect.

# The Senses Do Not Work in Isolation

.pull-left[

- Experiment by Lee and Aronson
    - 13- to 16 -month -old children placed in "swinging room"
- In the room, the floor was stationary but the walls and ceiling swung backward and forward.
- The movement creates optic flow patterns.
    - Children swayed back and forth in response the flow patterns created in the room.

Figure 7.6 Lee and Aronson’s swinging room. 
- (a) Moving the room toward the observer creates an optic flow pattern associated with moving forward, 
- so (b) the observer sways backward to compensate.

# The Senses Do Not Work in Isolation


![](fig_7_6c.png)

Figure 7.6 Lee and Aronson’s swinging room. 
- (c) As the room moves away from the observer, flow corresponds to moving backward, so the person leans forward to compensate and may even lose his or her balance. 


---

# The Senses Do Not Work in Isolation
- Adults show the same response as children when placed in the swinging room.
- Results show that vision has a powerful effect on balance and even overrides other senses that provide feedback about body placement and posture.

# Staying on Course: Walking and Driving

### Apply the concepts of optic flow (invariance &amp; FOE) &lt;br/&gt; to a person driving a car.
### Describe how people use flow information when driving and the research showing that people do not need to have flow information when walking.


---

# Walking
- **Visual direction strategy**: observers keep their body pointed toward a target
    - Walkers correct when target drifts to left or right.
- **Blind walking experiments** show that people can navigate without any visual stimulation from the environment.

Figure 7.8 A “blind walking” experiment (Philbeck et al., 1997). Red line: Subjects closed their eyes, walked toward a target 6 meters away, and stopped when they thought they had reached it. Green line: With closed eyes, subjects began walking in the wrong direction. Blue lines: Keeping their eyes closed, subjects turned at point 1 or point 2 and continued walking until they thought they had reached the target.

# Driving a Car
- Experiment by Land and Lee
    - Car fitted with instruments to measure
- Angle of steering wheel
- Speed of vehicle
- Direction of gaze of driver
    - When driving straight, driver looks straight ahead, but not at focus of expansion.

The ellipses indicate the place where the drivers were most likely to look while driving down (a) a straight road and (b) a curve to the left.

# Wayfinding
![:hline]()
### Discuss the role of landmarks in wayfinding, &lt;br/&gt; and the Gibsonian term “affordances”.
### Identify the neurons and brain areas that are believed to be responsible for navigation


---

# Wayfinding
- Landmarks involved taking routes that require making turns.
- **Landmarks** are objects on the route that serve as cues to indicate where to turn.

---

# Wayfinding
- Experiment by Janzen and van Turennout
    - Observers studied a film that moved through a "virtual museum."
    - They were told that they should be able to act as a guide within the museum.
    - Exhibits appeared both at decision points where turns were necessary and non-decision points.

---

# Wayfinding
- Observers were given a recognition task while in an fMRI.
    - They were presented with objects they had seen as exhibits, as well as ones they had not seen.
- Results showed the greatest activation for objects at decision points (landmarks) in the parahippocampal 
gyrus.

(c) Brain activation during the recognition test for objects that had been located at decision points (red bars) and non-decision points (blue bars). Notice that brain activation was greater for decision-point objects even if they weren’t remembered.

&gt; "While I'm working I hear in the background, I hear this it's the sound that the brain makes when the animal is moving. I hear place cells firing as though the animal is running. Well I'm a little bit concerned I think we may be the a the rats making a break for it I turn around, and fortunately rat is not scurrying, you know off toward the door."

&gt; "No, the animals asleep he's sound asleep. What I'm hearing is REM sleep rapid eye movement sleep, or what you think of as dream sleep. The rat is dreaming he's dreaming of running on this track. Well this wasn't - I wasn't doing this experiment to study sleep and dreaming, but there clearly is something surprising here."

&gt; "So, immediately, I start going to look at this data during sleep. And, what I find is indeed during sleep, immediately after running on one of these mazes. These patterns that you see here reappear. They're reactivated during sleep and in REM sleep indeed the animal is running. The place cells are firing. The animal is dreaming about running on the track. So, I immediately thought - 'I need to understand what's going on during sleep!'"

# Affordances

# Affordances - What Objects Are Used For
- Gibson believed affordances of objects are made up of information that indicates what an object is used for.
    - In other words, they indicate a "potential for action" as part of our perception.
    - People with certain types of brain damage show that even though they may not be able to name objects, they can still describe how they are used or can pick them up and use them.

Figure 7.16 Picking up a cup of coffee: (a) perceiving and recognizing the cup, (b) reaching for it, and (c) grasping and picking it up. This action involves coordination between perceiving and action that is carried out by two separate streams in the brain, as described in the text.

# Observing Other People’s Actions
![:hline]()
### Explain what mirror neurons are and how they were discovered.
### Debate why many focus on perception as a tool for action and survival instead of focusing only on perception as a tool for developing mental representations.


---

# Mirroring Others' Actions in the Brain
- **Mirror neurons** in the cortex of monkeys respond when a monkey grasps an object and when an experimenter grasps an object.
    - Response to the observed action "mirrors" the response of actually grasping.
    - There is a diminished response if an object is grasped by a tool (such as pliers).

Colors indicate the type of actions processed in each region: turquoise, movements directed toward objects; purple, reaching movements; orange, tool use; green, movements not directed toward objects; blue, upper limb movements.

# Mirroring Others' Actions in the Brain
- Possible functions of mirror neurons
    - To help understand another animal's actions and react to them appropriately
    - To help imitate the observed action
- **Audiovisual mirror neurons**: respond to action and the accompanying sound.
- Mirror neurons may help link sensory perceptions and motor actions.
