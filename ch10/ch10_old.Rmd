Perceiving Depth and Size
Perceiving Depth and Size


Perceiving Depth
Cue approach to depth perception:
Focuses on information in the retinal image that is correlated with depth in the scene
Occlusion
We learn the connection between the cue and depth.
The association becomes automatic through repeat exposure.
Perceiving Depth (cont'd.)



Oculomotor Cues
Oculomotor cues are based on sensing the position of the eyes and muscle tension.
Convergence: inward movement of the eyes when we focus on nearby objects.
Accommodation: the shape of the lens changes when we focus on objects at different distances.

Oculomotor Cues (cont'd.)



Monocular Cues
Monocular cues come from one eye
Pictorial cues: sources of depth information that come from 2-D images, such as pictures
Occlusion: when one object partially covers another
Relative height: objects below the horizon that are higher in the field of vision are more distant.
Objects above the horizon lower in the visual field are more distant.
Monocular Cues (cont'd.)
Relative size: when objects are equal size, the closer one will take up more of your visual field.
Perspective convergence: parallel lines appear to come together in the distance.
Familiar size: distance information is based on our knowledge of object size.

Monocular Cues (cont'd.)


Monocular Cues (cont'd.)
Atmospheric perspective: distance objects are fuzzy and have a blue tint.
Texture gradient: equally spaced elements are more closely packed as distance increases.
Shadows: indicate where objects are located
Enhance 3-D of objects

Motion-Produced Cues
Motion parallax: close objects in direction of movement glide rapidly past but objects in the distance appear to move slowly.
Deletion and accretion: objects are covered or uncovered as we move relative to them.
Covering an object: deletion
Uncovering an object is accretion

Binocular Depth Information
Stereoscopic depth perception
Depth perception created by input from both eyes



Binocular Depth Information (cont'd.)

Seeing Depth With Two Eyes (cont'd.)






Binocular Disparity
Binocular disparity: difference in images from two eyes
Difference can be described by examining corresponding points on the two retinas.
The horopter: imaginary sphere that passes through the point of focus
Objects on the horopter fall on corresponding points on the two retinas.



Binocular Disparity (cont'd.)
Objects that do not fall on the horopter fall on noncorresponding points
These points make disparate images.
The angle between these points is the absolute disparity.
The amount of disparity indicates how far an object is from the horopter.
Relative disparity is the difference between the absolute disparity of two objects.

Binocular Disparity (cont'd.)



Disparity (Geometrical) Created Stereopsis (Perceptual)
Stereopsis: depth information provided by binocular disparity
Stereoscope uses two pictures from slightly different viewpoints.
Random-dot stereogram has two identical patterns with one shifted in position.
Disparity (Geometrical) Created Stereopsis (Perceptual) (cont'd.)


The Correspondence Problem
How does the visual system match images from the two eyes?
Matches may be made by specific features of objects.
This may not work for objects like random-dot stereograms.
A satisfactory answer has not yet been proposed.
The Physiology of Binocular Depth Perception
Neurons have been found that respond best to binocular disparity.
These are called binocular depth cells or disparity selective cells.
These cells respond best to a specific degree of absolute disparity between images on the right and left retinas.

The Physiology of Binocular Depth Perception (cont'd.)
Experiment by Blake and Hirsch
Cats were reared by alternating vision between two eyes.
Results showed that they:
Had few binocular neurons
Were unable to use binocular disparity to perceive depth

The Physiology of Binocular Depth Perception (cont'd.)
Experiment by DeAngelis et al.
A monkey was trained to indicate depth from disparate images.
Disparity-selective neurons were activated by this process.
Experimenter used microstimulation to activate different disparity-selective neurons.
The monkey shifted judgment to the artificially stimulated disparity.

Perceiving Size
Distance and size perception are interrelated.
Experiment by Holway and Boring
Observer was at the intersection of two hallways.
A luminous test circle was in the right hallway placed from 10 to 120 feet away.
A luminous comparison circle was in the left hallway at 10 feet away.


Perceiving Size (cont'd.)
On each trial, the observer was to adjust the diameter of the test circle to match the comparison.
Test stimuli all had same visual angle (angle of object relative to the observer‚Äôs eye).
Visual angle depends on both the size of the object and the distance from the observer.
Perceiving Size (cont'd.)
Part 1 of the experiment provided observers with depth cues.
Judgments of size were based on physical size.
Part 2 of the experiment provided no depth information.
Judgments of size were based on size of the retinal images.

Size Constancy
Perception of an object‚Äôs size remains relatively constant.
This effect remains even if the size of the retinal image changes.
Size-distance scaling equation
S = K (R X D)
The changes in distance and retinal size balance each other.
Size Constancy (cont'd.)
Emmert‚Äôs law:
Retinal size of an afterimage remains constant.
Perceived size will change depending on distance of projection.
This follows the size-distance scaling equation.

Visual Illusions
Some illusions can be explained by the connection between the perception of size and the perception of depth.
The M√ºller-Lyer illusion
Straight lines with inward fins appear shorter than straight lines with outward fins.
Lines are actually the same length.

Visual Illusions (cont'd.)



The M√ºller-Lyer Illusion
Why does this illusion occur?
Misapplied size-constancy scaling:
Size constancy scaling that works in 3-D is misapplied for 2-D objects.
Observers unconsciously perceive the fins as belonging to outside and inside corners.
Outside corners would be closer and inside corners would be further away.
The M√ºller-Lyer Illusion (cont'd.)



The M√ºller-Lyer Illusion (cont'd.)
Explanation:
Since the retinal images are the same, the lines must be different sizes.
Problems with this explanation:
The ‚Äúdumbbell‚Äù version shows the same perception even though there are no ‚Äúcorners.‚Äù
The illusion also occurs for some 3-D displays.

The M√ºller-Lyer Illusion (cont'd.)
Another possible explanation:
Conflicting cues theory: our perception of line length depends on:
The actual length of the vertical lines
The overall length of the figure
The conflicting cues are integrated into a compromise perception of the length.
The Ponzo Illusion
Horizontal rectangular objects are placed over railroad tracks in a picture.
The far rectangle appears larger than the closer rectangle but both are the same size.
One possible explanation is misapplied size-constancy scaling.
The Ponzo Illusion (cont‚Äôd.)


The Ames Room
Two people of equal size appear very different in size in this room.
The room is constructed so that:
The shape looks like a normal room when viewed with one eye
The actual shape has the left corner twice as far away as the right corner
The Ames Room (cont'd.)



The Ames Room (cont'd.)



The Ames Room (cont'd.)
One possible explanation: size-distance scaling
Observer thinks the room is normal.
Women would be at same distance.
Woman on the left has smaller visual angle (R).
Due to the perceived distance (D) being the same, her perceived size (S) is smaller.

The Ames Room (cont'd.)
Another possible explanation: relative size
Perception of size depends on size relative to other objects.
One woman fills the distance between the top and bottom of the room.
The other woman only fills part of the distance.
Thus, the woman on the right appears taller.
The Moon Illusion
The moon appears larger on the horizon than when it is higher in the sky.
One possible explanation:
Apparent-distance theory: horizon moon is surrounded by depth cues while the moon higher in the sky has none.
The horizon is perceived as further away than the sky, and called ‚Äúflattened heavens‚Äù.
The Moon Illusion (cont'd.)
Explanation:
Since the moon in both cases has the same visual angle, it must appear larger at the horizon.
Another possible explanation:
Angular size-contrast theory: the moon appears smaller when surrounded by larger objects.
Thus, the large expanse of the sky makes it appear smaller.
Actual explanation may be a combination of a number of cues.
The Moon Illusion (cont'd.)

Depth Perception Across Species
Animals use the range of cues that humans use.
Frontal eyes, which result in overlapping fields of view, are necessary for binocular disparity.
Lateral eyes, which do not result in overlapping fields of view, provide a wider view.
This is important for watching for predators.
Depth Perception Across Species (cont'd.)




Depth Perception Across Species (cont'd.)
Locusts use motion parallax to judge distance.
Bats use echolocation to judge the distance of objects in the dark.
They emit sounds and note the interval between when they send them and when they receive the echo.
Depth Perception Across Species (cont'd.)



Infant Depth Perception
Binocular disparity becomes functional early.
Binocular disparity: binocularly fixate
Pictorial depth cues become functional later.
