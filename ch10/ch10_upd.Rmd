# Oculomotor Cues
Oculomotor cues are based on sensing the position of the eyes and muscle tension.
- **Convergence**: inward movement of the eyes when we focus on nearby objects.

# Seeing Depth With Two Eyes

- Differences between 2D and 3D movies


![](fig_10_14.png)

???

Figure 10.14 (a) and (b) 3-D movies are filmed using two side-by-side cameras so that each camera records a slightly different view of the scene. (c) The images are then projected onto the same 2-D surface. Without 3-D glasses, both images are visible to both eyes. 3-D glasses separate the images so that one is only seen by the left eye and the other is only seen by the right eye. When the left and right eyes receive these different images, stereoscopic depth perception occurs.

# Binocular Disparity

- Binocular **disparity**: difference in images from two eyes
    - Difference can be described by examining corresponding points on the two retinas. 
- The **horopter**: imaginary sphere that passes through the point of focus
    - Objects on the horopter fall on corresponding points on the two retinas.


![](fig_10_15.png)

???

Figure 10.15 Corresponding points on the two retinas. To determine corresponding points, imagine that the left eye is slid on top of the right eye. F indicates the fovea, where the image of an object occurs when an observer looks directly at the object, and A is a point in the peripheral retina. Images on the fovea always fall on corresponding points. Notice that the A’s, which also fall on corresponding points, are the same distance from the fovea in the left and right eyes.

- **Absolute disparity**: is the angle between these points.
- **Relative disparity**: difference between absolute disparities of two objects.

Julie’s images fall on the fovea, so they are on corresponding points. The arrows indicate that the tree’s images are located the same distances from the fovea in the two eyes, so they are also on corresponding points. The dashed line in (a) and (b) is the horopter. The images of objects that are on the horopter fall on corresponding points.

# The Physiology of Binocular Depth Perception
- Neurons have been found that respond best to binocular disparity.
    - These are called binocular depth cells or disparity selective cells.
- These cells respond best to a specific degree of absolute disparity between images on the right and left retinas.

Figure 10.26 The three relationships in the perceptual process, as applied to binocular disparity. We have described experiments relating disparity to perception (A) and relating disparity to physiological responding (B). The final step is to determine the relationship between physiological responses to disparity and perception (C). This has been studied by selective rearing, which eliminates disparity-selective neurons, and by microstimulation, which activates disparity-selective neurons.

# The Physiology of Binocular Depth Perception

- Experiment by Blake and Hirsch
    - Cats were reared by alternating vision between two eyes.
    - Results showed that they:
- Had few binocular neurons
- Were unable to use binocular disparity to perceive depth

# The Physiology of Binocular Depth Perception

.pull-left[
- Experiment by DeAngelis et al.
    - A monkey was trained to indicate depth from disparate images.
    - Disparity-selective neurons were activated by this process.

    - The monkey shifted judgment to the artificially stimulated disparity.

Figure 10.27 While the monkey was observing a random-dot stereogram, DeAngelis and coworkers (1998) stimulated neurons in the monkey’s cortex that were sensitive to a particular amount of disparity. This stimulation shifted the monkey’s perception of the depth of the field of dots from position 1 to position 2

# Perceiving Size
###	Discuss the method, results, and implications of Holway and Boring’s “hallway” research.
###	Define size constancy and state the size-distance scaling equation and its components.


---

# Perceiving Size
- Distance and size perception are interrelated.
- Experiment by Holway and Boring
    - Observer was at the intersection of two hallways.
    - A luminous test circle was in the right hallway placed from **10 to 120** feet away.
    - A luminous comparison circle was in the left hallway at **10** feet away.

![](Hand-angles-for-astronomers-reduced-size.jpg)

---

# Perceiving Size
On each trial:
- the observer adjusted the diameter of test circle to match the comparison.
- Test stimuli all had *same visual angle* 
- **Visual angle** depends on both the *size* of the object and the *distance* from the observer.

![](fig_10_29.png)

???

Figure 10.29 Setup of Holway and Boring’s (1941) experiment. The observer changes the diameter of the comparison circle in the left corridor to match his or her perception of the size of test circles presented in the right corridor. Each test circle has a visual angle of 1 degree and is presented separately. This diagram is not drawn to scale. The actual distance of the far test circle was 100 feet.

Figure 10.30 (a) The visual angle depends on the size of the stimulus (the woman in this example) and its distance from the observer. (b) When the woman moves closer to the observer, both the visual angle and the size of the image on the retina increase. This example shows that halving the distance between the stimulus and the observer doubles the size of the image on the retina. 


---

# Size Constancy
- Perception of an object's size remains relatively constant.
- This effect remains even if the size of the retinal image changes.
- **Size-distance scaling** equation
    - S = K (R X D)
    - The changes in distance and retinal size balance each other.

- s: actual object size
- r: retinal size

# Visual Illusions
.pull-left[
Some illusions can be explained by the connection between the perception of size and the perception of depth. 
  
The **Müller-Lyer** illusion
- Straight lines with inward fins appear shorter than straight lines with outward fins.
- Lines are actually the same length.
]


![](fig_10_39.png)

???

Figure 10.39 The Müller-Lyer illusion. Both lines are actually the same length. 


---

# The Müller-Lyer Illusion
- Why does this illusion occur?
    - Misapplied *size-constancy scaling*:
- Size constancy scaling that works in 3-D is misapplied for 2-D objects.
- Observers unconsciously perceive the fins as belonging to outside and inside corners.
- Outside corners would be *closer* and inside corners would be *further away*.

---

# The Müller-Lyer Illusion

![](fig_10_40.png)

???

Figure 10.40 According to Gregory (1966), the Müller-Lyer line on the left corresponds to an outside corner, and the line on the right corresponds to an inside corner. Note that the two vertical lines are the same length (measure them!). 


---

# The Müller-Lyer Illusion
- Explanation: 
    - Since the retinal images are the same, the lines must be different sizes.
- Problems with this explanation:
    - The "dumbbell" version shows the same perception even though there are no "corners."
    - The illusion also occurs for some 3-D displays.

---

# The Müller-Lyer Illusion
- Another possible explanation:
    - **Conflicting cues theory**: our perception of line length depends on:
- The actual length of the vertical lines
- The overall length of the figure
    - The conflicting cues are integrated into a compromise perception of the length.

---

# The Ames Room
.pull-left.font90[
- One possible explanation: *size-distance scaling*
    - Observer thinks the room is normal.
    - Women would be at same distance.
    - Woman on the left has smaller visual angle (R).
    - Due to the perceived distance (D) being the same, her perceived size (S) is smaller.
]

--

.pull-right.font90[
- Another possible explanation: *relative size*
    - Perception of size depends on size relative to other objects. 
    - One woman fills the distance between the top and bottom of the room.
    - The other woman only fills part of the distance.
    - Thus, the woman on the right appears taller.

# The Moon Illusion
- The moon appears larger on the horizon than when it is higher in the sky.
- One possible explanation:
    - **Apparent-distance theory**: horizon moon is surrounded by depth cues while the moon higher in the sky has none.
    - The horizon is perceived as further away than the sky, and called "flattened heavens".

![](fig_10_48.png)

???

Figure 10.48 When observers are asked to consider the sky as a surface and to compare the distance to the horizon (H) with the distance to the top of the sky on a clear moonless night, they usually say that the horizon appears farther away. This results in the “flattened heavens” shown here. 


---

# The Moon Illusion
.pull-left[
- Explanation: 
    - Since the moon in both cases has the same visual angle, it must appear larger at the horizon.
- Another possible explanation:
    - **Angular size-contrast** theory: the moon appears smaller when surrounded by larger objects.
    - Thus, the large expanse of the sky makes it appear smaller.
- Actual explanation may be a combination of a number of cues.

Figure 10.47 An artist’s conception of the how the moon is perceived when it is on the horizon and when it is high in the sky.

In the environment, the visual angles of the two moons are the same.
