Hearing
Physical and Perceptual Aspects of Sound
Two definitions of ‚Äúsound‚Äù
Physical definition: pressure changes in the air or other medium
Perceptual definition: the experience we have when we hear
Sound as Pressure Changes
Loud speakers produce sound through a process.
The diaphragm of the speaker moves out, pushing air molecules together called condensation.
The diaphragm also moves in, pulling the air molecules apart called rarefaction.
The cycle of this process creates alternating high- and low-pressure regions that travel through the air.
Sound as Pressure Changes (cont'd.)



Pure Tones
Pure tone: created by a sine wave
Amplitude: difference in pressure between high and low peaks of wave
Perception of amplitude is known as loudness.
Decibel (dB) is used as the measure of loudness.
Number of dB = 20 logarithm(p/po).
The decibel scale relates the amplitude of the stimulus with the psychological experience of loudness.

Pure Tones (cont'd.)
Frequency: number of cycles within a given time period
Measured in Hertz (Hz): 1 Hz is one cycle per second.
Perception of pitch is related to frequency.
Tone height is the increase in pitch that happens when frequency is increased.

Complex Tones and Frequency Spectra
Both pure and some complex tones are periodic tones.
Fundamental frequency is the repetition rate and is called the first harmonic.
Periodic complex tones consist of a number of pure tones called harmonics.
Additional harmonics are multiples of the fundamental frequency.
Complex Tones and Frequency Spectra (cont'd.)
Additive synthesis: process of adding harmonics to create complex sounds
Frequency spectrum: display of harmonics of a complex sound

Perceptual Aspects of Sound
Loudness is the perceptual quality most closely related to the level or amplitude of an auditory stimulus.

Audibility curve
Auditory response area

Perceptual Aspects of Sound (cont'd.)
Human hearing range: 20 to 20,000 Hz
Audibility curve: shows the threshold of hearing in relation to frequency
Changes on this curve show that humans are most sensitive to 2,000 to 4,000 Hz.
Auditory response area: falls between the audibility curve and the threshold for feeling.
It shows the range of response for human audition.
Perceptual Aspects of Sound (cont'd.)
Equal loudness curves: determined by using a standard 1,000 Hz tone
Two dB levels are used: 40 and 80
Participants match the perceived loudness of all other tones to the 1,000 Hz standard.
Resulting curves show that tones sound:
At almost equal loudness at 80 dB
Softer at 40 dB for high and low frequencies than the rest of the tones in the range

Perceptual Aspects of Sound (cont'd.)
Timbre: all other perceptual aspects of a sound besides loudness, pitch, and duration
It is closely related to the harmonics, attack, and decay of a tone.
Effect of missing fundamental frequency
Removal of the first harmonic results in a sound with the same perceived pitch, but with a different timbre.
This is called periodicity pitch.

Perceptual Aspects of Sound (cont'd.)




Perceptual Aspects of Sound (cont'd.)
Attack of tones: buildup of sound at the beginning of a tone
Decay of tones: decrease in sound at end of tone
From Pressure Changes to Electricity
Outer ear: pinna and auditory canal
Pinna helps with sound location.
Auditory canal: tube-like 3 cm long structure
Protects the tympanic membrane at the end of the canal
The resonant frequency of the canal amplifies frequencies between 1,000 and 5,000 Hz.
From Pressure Changes to Electricity (cont'd.)
Middle ear
Two cubic centimeter cavity separating inner from outer ear
Contains the three ossicles
Malleus: moves due to the vibration of the tympanic membrane
Incus: transmits vibrations of malleus
Stapes: transmits vibrations of incus to the inner ear via the oval window of the cochlea

Functioning of ossicles
Outer and inner ear are filled with air.
Inner ear is filled with fluid that is much denser than air.
Pressure changes in air transmit poorly into the denser medium.
Ossicles act to amplify the vibration for better transmission to the fluid.
Middle ear muscles dampen the ossicles‚Äô vibrations to protect the inner ear from potentially damaging stimuli.
From Pressure Changes to Electricity (cont'd.)
Inner ear
Main structure is the cochlea.
Fluid-filled snail-like structure (35 mm long) set into vibration by the stapes
Divided into the scala vestibuli and scala tympani by the cochlear partition
Cochlear partition extends from the base (stapes end) to the apex (far end).
Organ of Corti is contained by the cochlear partition.

Key structures
Basilar membrane vibrates in response to sound and supports the organ of Corti.
Inner and outer hair cells are the receptors for hearing.
Tectorial membrane extends over the hair cells.

From Pressure Changes to Electricity (cont'd.)
Transduction takes place through this process:
Cilia bend in response to movement of organ of Corti and the tectorial membrane.
Movement in one direction opens ion channels.
Movement in the other direction closes the channels.
This causes bursts of electrical signals.
B√©k√©sy Discovers How the Basilar Membrane Vibrates
B√©k√©sy‚Äôs Place Theory of Hearing
Frequency of sound is indicated by the place on the organ of Corti that has the highest firing rate.
B√©k√©sy determined this in two ways:
Direct observation of the basilar membrane in cadavers
Building a model of the cochlea using the physical properties of the basilar membrane
B√©k√©sy Discovers How the Basilar Membrane Vibrates (cont'd.)
Physical properties of the basilar membrane
Base of the membrane (by stapes) is:
Three to four times narrower than at the apex
100 times stiffer than at the apex
Both the model and direct observation showed that the vibrating motion of the membrane is a traveling wave.

Envelope of the traveling wave
Indicates the point of maximum displacement of the basilar membrane
Hair cells at this point are stimulated the most strongly leading to the nerve fibers firing the most strongly at this location.
Position of the peak is a function of frequency.

Tonotopic map
Cochlea shows an orderly map of frequencies along its length.
Apex responds best to low frequencies.
Base responds best to high frequencies.

Neural frequency tuning curves
Pure tones are used to determine the threshold for specific frequencies measured at single neurons.
Plotting thresholds for frequencies results in tuning curves.
Frequency to which the neuron is most sensitive is the characteristic frequency.

Returning to the Outer Hair Cells: The Cochlear Amplifier
B√©k√©sy used basilar membranes isolated from cadavers and his results showed no difference in response for close frequencies that people can distinguish.
New research with live membranes shows that the entire outer hair cells respond to sound by slight tilting and a change in length.
For this reason, these cells are called the cochlear amplifier.
The Physiology of Pitch Perception
Place theory: based on the relation between a sound‚Äôs frequency and the place along the basilar membrane that is activated.

The Physiology of Pitch Perception (cont'd.)
Phase locking
Nerve fibers fire in bursts.
Firing bursts happen at or near the peak of the sine-wave stimulus.
Thus, they are ‚Äúlocked in phase‚Äù with the wave.
Groups of fibers fire with periods of silent intervals creating a pattern of firing.

Pitch and the Brain
There is a shift from earlier emphasis on the cochlea and the auditory nerve to research on the brain.
Place coding is effective for the entire range of hearing.
Temporal coding with phase locking is effective up to 5,000 Hz.

Hearing Loss
Presbycusis
Greatest loss at high frequencies
Affects males more severely than females
Appears to be caused by exposure to damaging noises or drugs

Hearing Loss (cont'd.)
Noise-induced hearing loss
Loud noise can severely damage the organ of Corti.
OSHA standards for noise levels at work are set to protect workers.
Leisure noise can also cause hearing loss.

Cochlear Implants
Electrodes are inserted into the cochlea to electrically stimulate auditory nerve fibers.
The device is made up of:
A microphone worn behind the ear
A sound processor
A transmitter mounted on the mastoid bone
A receiver surgically mounted on the mastoid bone
