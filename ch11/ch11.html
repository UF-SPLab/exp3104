# Sound as Pressure Changes
.pull-left[
- Loud speakers produce sound through a process.
    - The diaphragm of the speaker moves out, pushing air molecules together called condensation.
    - The diaphragm also moves in, pulling the air molecules apart called rarefaction.
    - The cycle of this process creates alternating high &amp; low pressure regions that travel through the air.

**Outer ear** is filled with air.  

**Middle ear** muscles protect inner ear.
- Extremely loud noises engage reflex to dampen ossicles' vibrations.

**Inner ear** fluid is much denser than air 
- Air pressure changes from outer ear transmit poorly into the denser medium of inner ear cochlea. 

### **20 to 1 amplification ratio**   
- Tympanic membrane to Oval Window  
- Produces better transmission to fluid

### Step 3 – Receptor Processes
Transduction takes place through this process:
- Cilia bend in response to movement of organ of Corti and the tectorial membrane.
- Movement in one direction opens ion channels.
- Movement in the other direction closes the channels.
- This causes bursts of electrical signals.
