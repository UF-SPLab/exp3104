Figure 9.4 (a) White light contains all of the wavelengths of the spectrum. A beam of white light is symbolized here by showing beams with wavelengths associated with blue, green, yellow, and red. When white light hits the surface of the paper, the long-wavelength light is selectively reflected and the rest of the wavelengths are absorbed. We therefore perceive the paper as looking red. (b) When all of the wavelengths are reflected equally, we see white. (c) In this example of selective transmission, the long-wavelength light is transmitted and the other wavelengths are absorbed by the liquid.

# The Trichromatic Theory of Color Vision

Proposed by Young and Helmholtz (1800s)
- Three different receptor mechanisms are responsible for color vision.

Behavioral evidence supported the theory:
- Color-matching experiments
- Observers adjusted amounts of </br> three wavelengths in a comparison field </br> to match a test field of one wavelength.

Results showed that:
- It is possible to perform the matching task.
- Observers with normal color vision need at least three wavelengths to make the matches.
- Observers with color deficiencies can match colors by using only two wavelengths.

There is no difference in the responses of the two sets of receptors, so the two fields are perceptually indistinguishable.

(b) When the intensity of the 600-nm light is increased to 2,000, both wavelengths isomerize the same number of molecules, so the two wavelengths are perceived as identical.

### Define color constancy and lightness constancy.

# Color Constancy
**Color constancy**: relatively constant color perception  (in spite of changing light sources) 
- *Sunlight* ![:emoji city_sunrise] has equivalent energy amounts at all visible wavelengths.
- .orange[Tungsten incandescent] lighting has more energy in the long-wavelengths.
- .blue[LED lights] have some relative peaks in shorter wavelengths.

Figure 9.32 Determining what wavelengths are reflected from the green sweater under different illuminations. Light reflected from the sweater is determined by multiplying (a) the illumination of sunlight, incandescent, and LED lightbulbs times (b) the sweater’s reflectance. The result is (c) the light reflected from the sweater. The maximum of each of the curves in (c) has been set at the same level to make the wavelength distributions easier to compare



---

# Color Constancy
- **Chromatic adaptation** occurs when prolonged exposure to chromatic color leads to receptors:
    - "Adapting" when the stimulus color selectively bleaches a specific cone pigment
    - Decreasing in sensitivity to the color 
- Adaptation occurs to light sources leading to color constancy.

Adapting to this scene causes a decreased perception of yellow in the scene, as shown in (d).

# Lightness Constancy

**Achromatic colors** are perceived as remaining relatively constant.  
- **Perception of lightness**:
   - Is not related to the amount of light reflected by an object
   - Is related to the percentage of light reflected by an object 
- **The ratio principle**: when two areas that reflect *different* amounts of light look the *same*
   - if their **ratios of intensities** are the same
   - This works when objects are evenly illuminated.
