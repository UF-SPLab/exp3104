Figure 9.4 (a) White light contains all of the wavelengths of the spectrum. A beam of white light is symbolized here by showing beams with wavelengths associated with blue, green, yellow, and red. When white light hits the surface of the paper, the long-wavelength light is selectively reflected and the rest of the wavelengths are absorbed. We therefore perceive the paper as looking red. (b) When all of the wavelengths are reflected equally, we see white. (c) In this example of selective transmission, the long-wavelength light is transmitted and the other wavelengths are absorbed by the liquid.

# The Trichromatic Theory of Color Vision

# The Trichromatic Theory of Color Vision
- Proposed by Young and Helmholtz (1800s)
    - Three different receptor mechanisms are responsible for color vision.
- Behavioral evidence:
    - Color-matching experiments
- Observers adjusted amounts of three wavelengths in a comparison field to match a test field of one wavelength.


---

# The Trichromatic Theory of Color Vision
.pull-left[
- Results showed that:
    - It is possible to perform the matching task.
    - Observers with normal color vision need at least three wavelengths to make the matches.
    - Observers with color deficiencies can match colors by using only two wavelengths.

# Cone Responding and Color Perception
Color perception is based on the response of the three different types of cones.
- Responses vary depending on the wavelengths available.
- Combinations of responses across all 3 cone types lead to perception of all colors.

# Cone Responding and Color Perception

- Color matching experiments show that colors that are perceptually similar (metamers) can be caused by different physical wavelengths.

![](fig_9_13.png)

???

Figure 9.13 Principle behind metamerism. The proportions of 530-nm and 620-nm lights in the field on the left have been adjusted so that the mixture appears identical to the 580-nm light in the field on the right. The numbers indicate the responses of the short-, medium-, and long-wavelength receptors. There is no difference in the responses of the two sets of receptors, so the two fields are perceptually indistinguishable.

# .font50[Are Three Receptor Mechanisms Necessary for Color Vision?]

.pull-left[
One receptor type cannot lead to color vision
- Absorption of a photon causes the same effect, no matter what the wavelength is.
- Any two wavelengths can cause the same response by changing the intensity.
- Two receptor types (dichromats) solve this problem, but three types (trichromats) allow for perception of more colors.

Figure 9.15 Calculation of how many molecules of the visual pigment in Figure 9.14 are isomerized (a) when the intensity of both is 1,000 photons. In this case, the 480-nm light isomerizes 100 molecules and the 600-nm light isomerizes 50 molecules, so the 480-nm light would look brighter. (b) When the intensity of the 600-nm light is increased to 2,000, both wavelengths isomerize the same number of molecules, so the two wavelengths are perceived as identical.

# Color in A Dynamic World
![:hline]()
### Define color constancy and lightness constancy.


---

# Color Constancy
**Color constancy**: relatively constant color perception  (in spite of changing light sources) 
- *Sunlight* ![:emoji city_sunrise] has equivalent energy amounts at all visible wavelengths.
- .orange[Tungsten incandescent] lighting has more energy in the long-wavelengths.
- LED lights have some relative peaks in shorter wavelengths.


![](fig_9_32.png)

### Objects reflect different wavelengths from these sources.

???

Figure 9.32 Determining what wavelengths are reflected from the green sweater under different illuminations. Light reflected from the sweater is determined by multiplying (a) the illumination of sunlight, incandescent, and LED lightbulbs times (b) the sweater’s reflectance. The result is (c) the light reflected from the sweater. The maximum of each of the curves in (c) has been set at the same level to make the wavelength distributions easier to compare

---

# Color Constancy
- **Chromatic adaptation** occurs when prolonged exposure to chromatic color leads to receptors:
    - "Adapting" when the stimulus color selectively bleaches a specific cone pigment
    - Decreasing in sensitivity to the color 
- Adaptation occurs to light sources leading to color constancy.

Results
- **Baseline**: green paper is seen as green
- Observer **not adapted**: perception of green paper is shifted toward red

Figure 9.35 How chromatic adaptation to the dominant colors of the environment can influence perception of the colors of a scene. The dominant color of the scene in (a) is green. Looking at this scene causes adaptation to green and decreases the perception of green in the scene, as shown in (c). The dominant color of the arid scene in (b) is yellow. Adapting to this scene causes a decreased perception of yellow in the scene, as shown in (d).

# Lightness Constancy

**Achromatic colors** are perceived as remaining relatively constant.  
**Perception of lightness**:
- Is not related to the amount of light reflected by an object
- Is related to the percentage of light reflected by an object

--

**The ratio principle**: two areas that reflect different amounts of light look the same if the ratios of their intensities are the same
- This works when objects are evenly illuminated.
