    - accounts for 80% focusing.
- The **lens** 
    - adjusts shape for object distance

- Figure 2.9 Focusing of light rays by the eye. 
    - (a) Rays of light coming from a small light source that is more than 20 feet away are approximately parallel. The focus point for parallel light is at A on the retina. 
    - (b) Moving an object closer to the relaxed eye pushes the focus point back. Here the focus point is at B, but light is stopped by the back of the eye, so the image on the retina is out of focus. 
    - (c) Accommodation of the eye (indicated by the fatter lens) increases the focusing power of the lens and brings the focus point for a near object back to A on the retina, so it is in focus. This accommodation is caused by the action of the ciliary muscles, which are not shown. 
    - (d) In the myopic (nearsighted) eye, parallel rays from a distant spot of light are brought to a focus in front of the retina, so distant objects appear blurred. 
    - (e) A corrective lens bends light so it is focused on the retina.

# Light: The Stimulus for Vision

- Electromagnetic spectrum
    - Energy is described by wavelength.
    - Spectrum: from short wavelength gamma rays to long wavelength radio waves.
    - Visible spectrum for humans ranges from 400 to 700 nanometers.
    - Most perceived light is reflected light.

# .font70[Transforming Light Energy Into Electrical Energy]
Receptors have outer segments, which contain:
- Visual pigment molecules (two components):
    - **Opsin**,  a large protein
    - **Retinal**, a light sensitive molecule
- Visual transduction: retinal absorbs photon.
    - **Isomerization**: retinal changes its shape

The smaller molecule on top of the opsin is the light-sensitive retinal. (a) The retinal molecule’s shape before it absorbs light. (b) The retinal molecule’s shape after it absorbs light. This change in shape, which is called isomerization, triggers a sequence of reactions that culminates in generation of an electrical response in the receptor.

- Process needed for transduction:
    - Retinal molecule changes shape.
    - Opsin molecule separates.
    - The retina shows visual pigment bleaching.
    - Retinal and opsin must recombine to respond to light.

Figure 2.14 A frog retina was dissected from the eye in the dark and then exposed to light. The top row shows how the relationship between retinal and opsin changes after the retinal absorbs light. Only a small part of the opsin molecule is shown. The photographs in the bottom row show how the color of the retina changes after it is exposed to light. (a) This picture of the retina was taken just after the light was turned on. The dark red color is caused by the high concentration of visual pigment in the receptors that are still in the unbleached state. (b, c) After the retinal isomerizes, the retinal and opsin break apart, and the retina becomes bleached, as indicated by the lighter color.

- However, the relative sensitivities of the rods and the cones depend on the conditions of adaptation: 
    - The cones are more sensitive in the light, and 
    - the rods are more sensitive in the dark. 
- **circles**: rod curve are the absorption spectrum of the rod visual pigment. (intervals of 10)

Figure 2.25 How the flow of sodium and potassium creates the action potential. (a) When the fiber is at rest, there is no flow of ions, and the record indicates the 270 mV resting potential. (b) Ion flow occurs when an action potential travels down the fiber. Initially, positively charged sodium (Na1) flows into the axon, causing the inside of the neuron to become more positive (rising phase of the action potential). (c) Later, positively charged potassium (K1) flows out of the axon, causing the inside of the axon to become more negative (falling phase of the action potential). (d) When the action potential has passed the electrode, the charge returns to the resting level.
