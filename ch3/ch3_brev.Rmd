Figure 3.13 Two Chevreul staircase patterns that are physically identical, but the one on top has the light rectangle on the right and the one on the bottom has the light rectangle on the left. The patterns look different because they are placed on a luminance ramp that progresses from light on the left to dark on the right. The Chevreul effect is enhanced for the bottom pattern because the light to dark pattern of the Chevreul staircase progresses in the same direction as the luminance ramp.

Output of center-surround receptive fields depends on area stimulated:
- Highest response when only the *excitatory* area is stimulated
- Lowest response when only the *inhibitory* area is stimulated
- **Intermediate** responses when **both** areas are stimulated

Figure 3.18 Response of an excitatory-center, inhibitory-surround receptive field as stimulus size is increased. Shading indicates the area stimulated with light. The response to the stimulus is indicated below each receptive field. (a) Small response to a small dot in the excitatory center. (b) Increased response when the whole excitatory area is stimulated. (c) Response begins to decrease when the size of the spot is increased so that it stimulates part of the inhibitory surround; this illustrates center-surround antagonism. (d) Covering all of the inhibitory surround decreases the response further.

Signals from the retina travel through the optic nerve to the:
- Lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)
- Primary visual receiving area in the occipital lobe (the striate cortex or area V1)
- And then through two pathways to the temporal lobe and the parietal lobe
- Finally arriving at the frontal lobe

- LGN cells have center-surround receptive fields.
- Major function of LGN is to regulate neural information from the retina to the visual cortex.
    - Signals are received from the retina, the cortex, the brain stem, and the thalamus.
    - Signals are organized by eye, receptor type, and type of environmental information.

(b) Visual system seen from underneath the brain, showing the superior colliculus, which receives some of the signals from the eye. The optic chiasm is the place where some of the fibers from each eye cross over to the other side of the brain, so they reach the opposite hemisphere of the visual cortex

# Receptive Fields of Neurons in the Visual Cortex

- Neurons that fire to specific features of a stimulus
- Pathway away from retina shows neurons that fire to more complex stimuli.
- Cells that are **feature detectors**:
    - Simple cortical cell
    - Orientation tuning curve
    - Complex cortical cell
    - End-stopped cortical cell

# .font80[Do Feature Detectors Play a Role in Perception?]

### Describe the method used for selective adaptation to orientation, and discuss how the phenomenon is related to feature detectors.

---

# Selective Adaptation

- Neurons tuned to specific stimuli fatigue when exposure is long.

- Fatigue or **adaptation** to stimulus causes
    - Neural firing rate to *decrease*
    - Neuron to fire *less* when stimulus immediately presented again

- **Selective**: only neurons that respond to the **specific stimulus** adapt.

# Selective Adaptation

Gratings are used as stimuli.
- Made of alternating light and dark bars
- Angle relative to vertical can be changed to test for sensitivity to orientation.
- Difference in intensity can be changed to test for **sensitivity to contrast**.

]


???

Figure 3.28 The contrast threshold for a grating is the minimum difference in intensity at which the observer can just make out the bars. The grating on the left is far above the contrast threshold. The ones in the middle have less contrast but are still above threshold. The grating on the far right is near the contrast threshold. 


---

# Selective Adaptation


![](fig_3_29.png)

- Measure contrast threshold: decrease intensity of grating until too faint to see.
- Calculate the contrast sensitivity by taking 1/threshold.
- If threshold is low, person has high contrast sensitivity.

???

Figure 3.29 (a) Results of a psychophysical selective adaptation experiment. This graph shows that the person’s adaptation to the vertical grating causes a large decrease in her ability to detect the vertical grating when it is presented again but has less effect on gratings that are tilted to either side of the vertical.

# Selective Rearing

Animals are reared in environments that contain only certain types of stimuli.
- Neurons that respond to these stimuli will become more predominate due to neural plasticity.
- Blakemore and Cooper (1970) showed this by rearing kittens in tubes with either horizontal for vertical lines.
- Both behavioral and neural responses showed the development of neurons for the environmental stimuli.
