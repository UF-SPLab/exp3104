- (b) when receptor A and the receptors at B are stimulated together; 
- (c) when A and B are stimulated, with B stimulated at an increased intensity.

# Using Lateral Inhibition to Explain Perception

Three lightness perception phenomena are explained by **lateral inhibition**.  

- *The Hermann Grid*: seeing spots at an intersection

- *Mach Bands*: seeing borders more sharply

- *Simultaneous Contrast*: seeing areas of different brightness due to adjacent areas

Figure 3.13 Two Chevreul staircase patterns that are physically identical, but the one on top has the light rectangle on the right and the one on the bottom has the light rectangle on the left. The patterns look different because they are placed on a luminance ramp that progresses from light on the left to dark on the right. The Chevreul effect is enhanced for the bottom pattern because the light to dark pattern of the Chevreul staircase progresses in the same direction as the luminance ramp.

Figure 3.16 (a) Hartline’s experiment in which he presented stimuli to the retina by dissecting a frog’s eye and removing the top to create an “eyecup.” He then presented light to the retina to determine which area of a frog’s retina caused firing in one of the fibers in the optic nerve. This area is called the receptive field of that optic nerve fiber. (b) Receptive fields of three optic nerve fibers. These receptive fields overlap, so stimulating at a particular point on the retina will generally activate a number of fibers in the optic nerve.

Excitatory and inhibitory effects are found in receptive fields.

Output of center-surround receptive fields depends on area stimulated:

- Lowest response when only the *inhibitory* area is stimulated
- **Intermediate** responses when **both** areas are stimulated

The response to the stimulus is indicated below each receptive field. (a) Small response to a small dot in the excitatory center. (b) Increased response when the whole excitatory area is stimulated. (c) Response begins to decrease when the size of the spot is increased so that it stimulates part of the inhibitory surround; this illustrates center-surround antagonism. (d) Covering all of the inhibitory surround decreases the response further.

# Selective Adaptation

- Neurons tuned to specific stimuli fatigue when exposure is long.

- Fatigue or **adaptation** to stimulus causes
    - Neural firing rate to *decrease*
    - Neuron to fire *less* when stimulus immediately presented again

- **Selective**: only neurons that respond to the **specific stimulus** adapt.
